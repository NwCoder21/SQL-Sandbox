# Aggregate Functions

<!-- L 129 - Section Introduction --> 

In this section, we are going to learn a lot about different ways of performing analysis on data. 

For example, finding averages, grouping data together, grouping by columns, 
calculating average quantities, find the average sales that we've had per year, 
we could do things like find the average page number for books per genre
 

If you're working with advertising data or let's say our Instagram data, which we will be using later on, 
do things like find out which one of our users is a power user or influencers, 
meaning that they have the most comments, the most likes on each one of their posts on average.

So who in our database is getting on average the most likes and comments?
Or we could do things like which hashtag generates the most traction.

# Count Basics 

We are going to learn about functions that can operate on multiple rows or multiple pieces 
of data at once to tell us the min or the max or the average or the sum or the count.

First, we will start with Count.

---

The Count function is a built-in function like `REPLACE`, `CONCAT`, `UPPER` etc. Can use it to count, in our example, how many books are in the database.

This means there are 19 rows in our database. 

`COUNT (*)` tells MySQL we want to count the rows that we get back from this query.

When we try to combine other functions with `COUNT`, will get an error as whole point of `COUNT` is to output a single value.

## How many author_fname are there? 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208422258-54777d8e-07cf-4e73-af67-36f4277b3a4b.png)

To check How many author_fname are there, instead of using `SELECT COUNT (*)`, which counts all the rows, we can use `SELECT COUNT (author_fname)`, which will count all the first names or all the values in that column.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208422572-c6eb6ea5-fa60-4dee-ae0d-c7c7459d2940.png)

We  still get 19. This is because it is counting everytime there is a value in the `author_fname` column.

---

To test this out, let's add two (empty )more rows into our books table:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208423090-0f326ac5-d8df-44aa-8308-f743615fd8f2.png)

---

Now when we count the rows, we will see that there are two more rows. So, in total, 21 rows.

---

But if we count `author_fname`, we will see that there are 19 because two of those rows are empty and there is no `author_fname`, they have null in them.

### How many DISTINCT `author-fname` are there?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208423705-dac6f8b1-94e1-41a6-8b7c-3e01f8edc230.png)

What may be more useful is knowing how many unique `author_fname` there are in our table. The way that we do this is we actually pass `DISTINCT` into the parentheses.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208424183-8f182a2f-1234-4f85-8c7f-02f070ef9303.png)

These are the list of author first names.

We can use `DISTINCT` to count each unique author first name once.

---

Next, let's see how we can check how many (amount of) titles contain "the"?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208427583-f199f054-6687-4152-b749-0bb2d0049483.png)

These are the titles which contain "the". But we want to count how many rows are there.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208427898-651bc489-2369-46b1-aff4-2dcb84e1bdf9.png)

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books
WHERE title LIKE '%the%';
```

This means count the rows where title has the word "the" within it.
