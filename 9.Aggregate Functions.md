# Aggregate Functions

<!-- L 129 - Section Introduction --> 

In this section, we are going to learn a lot about different ways of performing analysis on data. 

For example, finding averages, grouping data together, grouping by columns, 
calculating average quantities, find the average sales that we've had per year, 
we could do things like find the average page number for books per genre
 

If you're working with advertising data or let's say our Instagram data, which we will be using later on, 
do things like find out which one of our users is a power user or influencers, 
meaning that they have the most comments, the most likes on each one of their posts on average.

So who in our database is getting on average the most likes and comments?
Or we could do things like which hashtag generates the most traction.

---

<!-- L 130 - Count Basics --> 

# Count Basics 

We are going to learn about functions that can operate on multiple rows or multiple pieces 
of data at once to tell us the min or the max or the average or the sum or the count.

First, we will start with Count.

---

The Count function is a built-in function like `REPLACE`, `CONCAT`, `UPPER` etc. Can use it to count, in our example, how many books are in the database.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208420921-a3da5da0-c4ea-4c02-82c1-9504c87d78cc.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208421092-e8129be1-54b7-4943-b87d-79fe7c3238d5.png)

This means there are 19 rows in our database. 

`COUNT (*)` tells MySQL we want to count the rows that we get back from this query.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208421942-f2ef27a4-90cd-437a-85d8-14a7332c91fa.png)

When we try to combine other functions with `COUNT`, will get an error as whole point of `COUNT` is to output a single value.

---

## How many author_fname are there? 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208422258-54777d8e-07cf-4e73-af67-36f4277b3a4b.png)

To check How many author_fname are there, instead of using `SELECT COUNT (*)`, which counts all the rows, we can use `SELECT COUNT (author_fname)`, which will count all the first names or all the values in that column.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208422572-c6eb6ea5-fa60-4dee-ae0d-c7c7459d2940.png)

We  still get 19. This is because it is counting everytime there is a value in the `author_fname` column.

---

To test this out, let's add two (empty )more rows into our books table:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208423090-0f326ac5-d8df-44aa-8308-f743615fd8f2.png)

---

Now when we count the rows, we will see that there are two more rows. So, in total, 21 rows.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208423353-1afde2a9-e606-48cd-a4dd-ad68d3d36c4f.png)

---

But if we count `author_fname`, we will see that there are 19 because two of those rows are empty and there is no `author_fname`, they have null in them.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208423444-6368a192-083d-4237-aa93-da0757d896d9.png)


---

### How many DISTINCT `author-fname` are there?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208423705-dac6f8b1-94e1-41a6-8b7c-3e01f8edc230.png)

What may be more useful is knowing how many unique `author_fname` there are in our table. The way that we do this is we actually pass `DISTINCT` into the parentheses.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208424183-8f182a2f-1234-4f85-8c7f-02f070ef9303.png)

These are the list of author first names.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208424014-27e32e5b-b30d-472c-99c4-df2eba62152c.png)

We can use `DISTINCT` to count each unique author first name once.

---

Next, let's see how we can check how many (amount of) titles contain "the"?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208427583-f199f054-6687-4152-b749-0bb2d0049483.png)

These are the titles which contain "the". But we want to count how many rows are there.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208427898-651bc489-2369-46b1-aff4-2dcb84e1bdf9.png)

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books
WHERE title LIKE '%the%';
```

This means count the rows where title has the word "the" within it.

---

<!-- L 132 - GROUP BY --> 

# `GROUP BY`

This is one of the most useful and most important clauses in all of SQL, which is `GROUP BY`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208436873-ca9d2a8f-0126-4d58-a6bd-ac706c89ae91.png)

So, what does the above definition mean? 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208436998-72692f3f-3393-4c5e-a636-18d9d5a62736.png)

`GROUP BY` is followed by a column name. In this case, it will group the rows from our books table based on the `author_lname`. Once they have been grouped, we can ask, how many books has each author written. For example, we had the below table:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208437377-19a38eef-b137-4201-9750-8a0b0cbfddf0.png)

The below is what would happen behind the scenes (and is not what would be displayed). We can then use this information to ask(using `COUNT`), for example, how many books has Lahiri written.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208438058-42b269dd-ac4f-4c33-a450-ee72273af3e6.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208438343-55fb6676-8d54-4ab9-84cd-1db37d8ce8d2.png)


```sql
SELECT author_lname, COUNT(*) 
FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;
```

This shows us how many books has each author written. It does this by counting the rows of each different group, not all the rows in the whole table,
but the rows in each group.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208439141-08a01fe2-c9c4-4df5-b326-b549d97e0a61.png)

This means there will e two rows for Lahiri, two rows for Gaiman and 1 row for Eggers etc. 

We would end up with something like this.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208443164-407fc58c-beac-4fde-8cdc-69436bb89b2a.png)

In our example, we can then also use `ORDER BY` to put them into order.

```sql
SELECT author_lname, COUNT(*) AS books_written
FROM books GROUP BY author_lname
ORDER BY books_written DESC;
```

---

# Another Example - Grouping by `released_year`.

Another example, let's try grouping by `released_year`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208443936-d12e0b5c-246e-4469-b7b6-a522263d3ea1.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208445118-f93f910f-4e67-4a06-bd39-fc8542a1b55d.png)

Now, if we do `SELECT released_year FROM books GROUP BY released_year;` it will display the distinct years. So, we need to also use `COUNT(*)` to see how many rows there are for each group. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208446119-39273ac7-5e4a-433e-9317-53d68a738ad2.png)

Can add `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;` to order the data according to the rows for each group too. 

---

Or can sort it using an Alias. such as:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208446476-f9aef4ff-1aaf-47db-aefe-64d188a28543.png)

---

Generally the formula is, we will `GROUP BY` some column, and then we might use that column in our `SELECT`,
but then we almost always are going to have some aggregate function going on like `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVERAGE` and `SUM`.

---

# Codecademy Notes on `GROUP BY`

Oftentimes, we will want to calculate an aggregate for data with certain characteristics.

For instance, we might want to know the mean IMDb ratings for all movies each year. We could calculate each number by a series of queries with different WHERE statements, like so:

```sql
SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 1999;
 
SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 2000;
 
SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 2001;
```

and so on. Luckily, there’s a better way!
We can use `GROUP BY` to do this in a single step:

```sql
SELECT year, AVG(imdb_rating) FROM movies
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;
```

`GROUP BY` is a clause in SQL that is used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the `SELECT` statement to arrange identical data into groups.

**The `GROUP BY` statement comes after any `WHERE` statements, but before `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT`.**

This is the databse.

---

Sometimes, we want to `GROUP BY` a calculation done on a column.

For instance, we might want to know how many movies have IMDb ratings that round to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We could do this using the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY ROUND(imdb_rating)
ORDER BY ROUND(imdb_rating);
```

However, this query may be time-consuming to write and more prone to error.

SQL lets us use column reference(s) in our `GROUP BY` that will make our lives easier.

* 1 is the first column selected
* 2 is the second column selected
* 3 is the third column selected

and so on.

The following query is equivalent to the one above:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

Here, the `1` refers to the first column in our `SELECT` statement, `ROUND(imdb_rating)`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208686855-0d79dbf7-251c-4a4c-a956-29ca428edc80.png)

# `MIN` and `MAX` Basics

`MIN` helps us find the minimum value in a certain column, but also as we'll see shortly, within a certain group. `MAX` helps us find the maximum value.

---

First we will look at how `MIN` and `MAX` are used without `GROUP BY`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208452324-4629f76d-b384-41f2-b1bb-dc87bc54180e.png)

Find the minimum release year, in other words, the earliest year a book was published in our table, but it does not show which book this belongs to. Will cover this shortly.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208452626-ae671334-364f-4550-929e-23a352b1b9b8.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208452976-98f5a816-bf56-4649-9388-d1fd0ce4d8e9.png)

To find the longest book, we can use the above. But again, we don't know exactly which row/title that belongs to. What's the title of that book? Will cover this shortly.

---

Can combine `MIN` and `MAX`, such as:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208453691-208a8a5a-3594-4d00-a46c-5cda2c2f9ccd.png)

And now we're finding the lowest or the earliest alphabetically and the latest alphabetically.

---

Normally, we use `MIN` and `MAX` for numerical values.

---

# What if I Want to Know the Title of the Longest Book?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208454135-cf87947c-5ae3-47e1-8902-3333f77eb93e.png)

We know how to find the longest book but how do we know which books this belongs to.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208454402-a41c789b-b69c-4e40-9a64-da450e3f0138.png)

If we try to use `SELECT MAX(pages), title FROM books;` an error occurs.

Remember: whenever we aggregate things, we can only work with the data that they have in common. Even though in this case, we did not use `GROUP BY`, the program does as `MAX` is a type of aggregated query. 

It's saying which title.

It's looking at all the pages it is aggregating and it's finding the max, but it doesn't know which title to display because it only gives us a single value back. It's not smart enough, or it's not set up in such a way to give us the title of that book.

---

<!-- L 136 - Subqueries -->

# Subqueries

How do I retrieve the entire row or just the title of that longest book? So there's a couple of options.


1. We can `ORDER BY` pages and then `LIMIT`. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208455769-4a327ad4-f7ac-4a24-b0dc-878a97f1953d.png)

---

2. The second option is quite a bit different.

```sql
SELECT * FROM books 
WHERE pages = (SELECT Min(pages) 
                FROM books); 
```

It involves using something called a subquery. A subquery is a query within a larger query. We surround it with brackets. This tells SQL to run: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208456286-8c76c799-269e-4c43-9307-b0fa38e3438b.png)

this first. That will be evaluated to string/number and then the first query will run.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208456947-2dd61997-a83f-4607-b39b-4b01d3fd46ca.png)

So, first ` = (SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books);` will run. The result of this, in this case 634, is used in the first query. So, the first queiry will then lool like:
`SELECT title, pages FROM books WHERE pages = 634`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208457590-bccd3a0e-93c0-4ac3-a95d-9d2c08f04f5a.png)

---

This works when there is only one maximum, meaning that there's only one row that has 634.

Let's add anothr row with 634. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208458056-bced7da0-e02c-4bc6-9888-261e9b476f59.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208458237-70ba56d0-5e36-42f8-a3a5-c6922ade7254.png)

Now  if we run our query again, we get both books.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208458524-94a0fd6b-eb06-44c6-bafa-42bf7328fd66.png)

If we used the first solution, we would have to know beforehand that there are two books with 534 pages and LIMIT it by 2, such as:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208458693-94caddda-c1b0-4d02-a404-a73681715844.png)

---

But if we're just looking for one, and we know there's only one, then you won't t need to bother with a subquery necessarily.

---

Another example: find the title of the book that was released earliest?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208462342-8da8568c-c40a-4d4e-aa21-330e1c2e85aa.png)

```sql
SELECT title, released_year FROM books 
WHERE released_year = (SELECT MIN(released_year) FROM books);
```

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, you have to use parentheses around any sort of subquery.

---
<!-- L 138 - Grouping By Multiple Columns -->

# Grouping By Multiple Columns

Also need to learn about Grouping By Multiple Columns. In our dataset, we know that there's authors that have the same last name but not the same first name.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208689852-9b66929f-d25c-48c7-a1c1-50f9e41d444d.png)

From this we can see that the surname `Harris` belongs to two different people, whilst names such as Carver, Eggers, Foster Wallace, Gaiman belong to the same first name.

---

So, if we do: 

```sql
SELECT author_lname, COUNT(*) FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208690724-be7d6ae3-6919-45e2-baf4-b5ec013711ea.png)

we can see that the name `Harris` has two books, but this does not tell the whole picture as there are tw authors named harris who have one book each. From the above results, all we know is that there is one last name which has two books. 

---

So, we probably want to write a query that actually groups by the last name and the first name. So instead we can add on a second part to the `GROUP BY` after `author_lname`, we will also add `author_fname`, for example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208692088-3ab4f3fe-4293-451b-9fd1-f143424485a7.png)

Now we see two `Harris`. This is because one is based on `Harris, Freida` and the othr is `Harris, Dan`

--- 

We can also display the `author_fname`, such as 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208692489-4f8de487-f0c0-4ebb-96d0-dd5d85820795.png)

For Harris, there will be two counts as one for each different first name. 

---

We could even `GROUP BY` just one thing if we concatenated author first name and last name to be a full name: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208694974-6d0cbcb0-3089-494a-8274-d50e2fc69f6d.png)

In this example, we are counting how many occurrences or how many rows have the full name as their author. For example, Dave Eggers occurs 3 times, Dan Harris occuers once, David Foster Wallace occurs twice.  

```diff
- `COUNT(*)` means how many rows exist in each one of these groups that are created by Author that are created by `GROUP BY Author`?
```

---
<!-- L140. MIN and MAX With GROUP BY -->

#  `MIN` and `MAX` With `GROUP BY`

As discussed previously, we can use `MIN` and `MAX`, both built-in functions, on their own without any grouping. But we can also use it with `GROUP BY`, just the way 
we can use `COUNT` on its own or with `GROUP BY`

---

So, we can do things like: 

* Find the year each author published their first book. In other words, group all of the books by the same authors together and then find the minimum year for that author.

```sql
SELECT author_lname FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;
```

The above code will create the groups.

We don't want to find the count that's going to tell us how many books that each author has written, instead, we want to know what is the minimum released year within each one of those groups.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208709291-741a5da2-ea91-4ecb-bd17-c8a8a6947755.png)


```sql
SELECT author_lname, Min(released_year)  FROM books 
GROUP  BY author_lname; 
```

---

Moving on: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208709809-26651d7e-cf2b-4b87-8149-0e07a3a0cff9.png)

Here, we are checking for the earliest and latest date an author has released a book.

```sql
SELECT author_lname, Min(released_year), MAX(released_year) FROM books 
GROUP  BY author_lname; 
```

---

And that's the basic concept here. We formed our groups and then we can, within each group, find the minimum or the max or the count. An example of the count is: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208711164-b2925e17-7b5c-4ecb-a629-28d88606cb69.png)

---

But the issue is there are some authors (surname of Harris) who have a different first name and the above does not take that into account. So:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208711599-575b6641-f94f-4139-b4e3-0c24f2a10607.png)

addresses that issue as it now groups by the first AND last name.

```sql
SELECT author_fname, author_lname, 
Min(released_year) As earliest_release, 
MAX(released_year) As lateest_release, 
COUNT(*) As books_written,
MAX(pages) As longest_page_count
FROM books 
GROUP BY author_fname, author_lname; 
```

---

```diff
- `GROUP BY` means group by each different value in the column which follows `GROUP BY`
```

---

<!-- L142- SUM ---> 

# `SUM`

This is another aggregate fucntion. This sums up values together.

For example, we could select the sum of all the pages in the entire table, in other words, the page count from books,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208714086-80a30802-bf58-42ae-9fda-756e0d20471b.png)

---

But we can also operate within groups using `SUM`. For example, SUM all pages each author has written:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208715213-c96c4e96-54af-4602-8934-a5ffae8ccb71.png)

This is the full table.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208714770-2e001647-4997-4022-bcb7-15048c315fa5.png)

```sql
SELECT author_fname, author_lname, SUM(pages) FROM books
GROUP BY author_fname, author_lname;
```
Here they are all counted up together for each author 

---

<!-- L144- AVG  ---> 

# `AVG`
