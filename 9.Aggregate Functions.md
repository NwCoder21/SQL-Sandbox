# Aggregate Functions

<!-- L 129 - Section Introduction --> 

In this section, we are going to learn a lot about different ways of performing analysis on data. 

For example, finding averages, grouping data together, grouping by columns, 
calculating average quantities, find the average sales that we've had per year, 
we could do things like find the average page number for books per genre
 

If you're working with advertising data or let's say our Instagram data, which we will be using later on, 
do things like find out which one of our users is a power user or influencers, 
meaning that they have the most comments, the most likes on each one of their posts on average.

So who in our database is getting on average the most likes and comments?
Or we could do things like which hashtag generates the most traction.

We are going to learn about functions that can operate on multiple rows or multiple pieces 
of data at once to tell us the min or the max or the average or the sum or the count.

Fisrt, we will start with Count.
