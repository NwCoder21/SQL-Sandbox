# Project - Analyze Hacker News Trends

The hacker_news table has the following columns:

* title
* user
* score
* timstamp
* url 
---

Step 1: start by getting a feel for the hacker_news table!

Let’s find the most popular Hacker News stories:

```sql
SELECT title, score
FROM hacker_news
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

What are the top five stories with the highest scores?

HINT:
Using `LIMIT` caps the number of rows in the result.

It is a simple way to keep queries from taking too long to run if you are dealing with a big dataset.

`ORDER BY` simply sorts the score column.

The most popular stories are:

* ‘Penny Arcade - Surface Pro 3 update’
* ‘Hacking The Status Game’
* ‘Postgres CLI with autocompletion and syntax highlighting’
* ‘Stephen Fry hits out at ‘infantile’ culture of trigger words and safe spaces’
* ‘Reversal: Australian Govt picks ODF doc standard over Microsoft’

## Hacker News Moderating

Step 2: Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users (1-9-90 Rule).

Is this true of Hacker News?

Is a small percentage of Hacker News submitters taking the majority of the points?

First, find the total score of all the stories.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210809465-488c86b8-a750-4024-9b38-0b8333cc4ca4.png)

The total score of this table is 6366.

---

Step 3: Next, we need to pinpoint the users who have accumulated a lot of points across their stories.

Find the individual users who have gotten combined scores of more than 200, and their combined scores.

`GROUP BY` and `HAVING` are needed!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210810059-206cb93e-bcab-4aa4-a894-f2b0ef141478.png)

```sql
SELECT user, SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY user
HAVING SUM(score) > 200
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

`HAVING` does not support aliases in the same way that `ORDER BY` does, so use the full column name.

---

Step 4: Then, we want to add these users’ scores together and divide by the total to get the percentage.

Add their scores together and divide it by the total sum. Like so:

`SELECT (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 6.0;`

So, is Hacker News dominated by these users?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210810681-d60559bb-4e6d-4a9e-a5a1-8d579f5371ac.png)

That is ≈ 22%.

These 4 users have a combined 22% of the total scores in the table. 

---

Step 5: How many times has each offending user posted this link? The url of the video is: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210812227-496ac654-cf6d-45b7-affd-e4d58edf057b.png)

You can `GROUP BY` the users and use `WHERE` to restrict url:

```sql
SELECT user, COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
WHERE url LIKE '%watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ%'
GROUP BY user
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

Rewrite this using column reference numbers instead of column names:

-- Hacker News Moderating

```sql
SELECT user, COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
WHERE url LIKE '%watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

Dear @sonnynomnom, you’re banned.
Dear @scorpiosister, warning!

### Which sites feed Hacker News?

---


Step 6: Hacker News stories are essentially links that take users to other websites.

Which of these sites feed Hacker News the most:

GitHub, Medium, or New York Times?

First, we want to categorize each story based on their source.

We can do this using a `CASE` statement:

```sql
SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   -- WHEN statement here
   -- WHEN statement here
   -- ELSE statement here
  END AS 'Source'
FROM hacker_news;
```
Fill in the other WHEN statements and the ELSE statement

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210813957-580f4a25-a89e-4f8c-ae6d-92a2bf8262b5.png)

HINT:
Your query should look like:

```sql
SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source'
FROM hacker_news;
```

`--` starts a single line comment. The text after `--` will be ignored (not executed).

Note: If we want to be more accurate, we should use `url LIKE '%github%'` because some GitHub pages end with .io instead of .com.

---

Step 7: Next, build on the previous query:

Add a column for the number of stories from each URL using COUNT().

Also, `GROUP BY` the `CASE` statement.

Remember that you can refer to a column in `GROUP BY` using a number.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210815110-3a63c6ad-d0ee-4de8-a6fa-9af9484583b9.png)

HINT:

```sql
-- Which sites feed Hacker News?
 
SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source',
  COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1;
```

The number of times stories are linked to:

* GitHub - 23
* Medium - 12
* New York Times - 13

---

Another example is using the fake_apps table:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210820037-920528d8-c2f4-4205-94a8-92c3ed1c0b04.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210819287-7a82cc44-bbd8-49fa-82a4-17a42506b5a7.png)

Here, we are putting the rpices into one of three categories and then counting the amount of apps in each group.

### What's the best time to post a story?

---

Step 8: Every submitter wants their story to get a high score so that the story makes it to the front page, but…

What’s the best time of the day to post a story on Hacker News?

Before we get started, let’s run this query and take a look at the timestamp column:

```sql
SELECT timestamp
FROM hacker_news
LIMIT 10;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210820651-28434b3c-12db-4b46-9e8b-5a337b2c3a9e.png)


Notice that the values are formatted like:

`2018-05-08T12:30:00Z`

If you ignore the T and Z, the format is:

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

HINT:
The `T` is just the separator between the date and time. You can read it as an abbreviation for ‘Time’.

The `Z` stands for the Zero timezone, as it is offset by 0 from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

If you don’t look at the `T` and `Z`, it is easier to see the pattern in the timestamp column.

---

Step 9: SQLite comes with a `strftime()` function - a very powerful function that allows you to return a formatted date.

It takes two arguments:

`strftime(format, column)`

Let’s test this function out:

```sql
SELECT timestamp,
   strftime('%H', timestamp)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 20;
```

What do you think this does? Open the hint if you’d like to learn more.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210823632-4f78101c-9cda-415a-a38b-dd9f97d55d64.png)

This returns the hour, HH, of the timestamp column!

For `strftime(__, timestamp)`:

* %Y returns the year (YYYY)
* %m returns the month (01-12)
* %d returns the day of the month (1-31)
* %H returns 24-hour clock (00-23)
* %M returns the minute (00-59)
* %S returns the seconds (00-59)

if timestamp format is `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.

Read more on the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html)

---

Step 10: Okay, now we understand how strftime() works. Let’s write a query that returns three columns:

* The hours of the timestamp
* The average score for each hour
* The count of stories for each hour

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210825790-10f43cb1-598f-4bda-bc9c-55bbe8d81ca6.png)

```sql
SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp), 
AVG(score),COUNT(*) FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

---

Step 11:

Let’s edit a few things in the previous query:

* Round the average scores (ROUND()).
* Rename the columns to make it more readable (AS).
* Add a WHERE clause to filter out the NULL values in timestamp.

Take a look at the result again:

What are the best hours to post a story on Hacker News?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210825322-1ee31756-c9e8-41eb-9830-2aae66259a8d.png)

HINT:
The `ROUND()` function returns a number or column rounded to a certain number of decimal places.

For example, ROUND(temp, 2) rounds the temp values to 2 decimal places.

The final query should look something like:

```sql
-- What's the best time to post a story?
 
SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp) AS 'Hour', 
   ROUND(AVG(score), 1) AS 'Average Score', 
   COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Stories'
FROM hacker_news
WHERE timestamp IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

The best hours are in the morning around 7 am and afternoon around 6 - 8 pm! Monster difference!
