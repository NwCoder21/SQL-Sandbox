# Project - Lyft Trip Data

Let’s practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.

Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

* `trips`: trips information
* `riders`: user data
* `cars`: autonomous cars

---

Step 1: Let’s examine the three tables

`trips` table:

`riders` table:

`cars`: autonomous cars

What are the column names?

HINT:

`trips` table

* `id` - trip ID
* `date` - trip date
* `pickup` - pickup time stamp
* `dropoff` - drop-off time stamp
* `rider_id` - user ID
* `car_id` - car ID
* `type` - type of trip (X, POOL, XL)
* `cost` - trip cost

`riders` table

* `id` - user ID
* `first` - user first name
* `last` - user last name
* `username` - user handle
* `rating` - user average rating
* `total_trips` - total rides ridden
* `referred` - referred by (user ID)

`cars` table

* `id` - car ID
* `model` - car model
* `OS` - operating system
* `status` - active or maintenance
* `trips_completed` - total trips completed


---

Step 2: 

* What’s the primary key of `trips`?
* What’s the primary key of `riders`?
* What’s the primary key of `cars`?

Answer: 

* The primary key of `trips` is `id`.
* The primary key of `riders` is `id`.
* The primary key of `cars` is `id`.

They have the same name, but they are very different.

Step 3: Try out a simple cross join between `riders` and `cars`.

Is the result useful?
