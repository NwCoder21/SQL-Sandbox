# Project - Lyft Trip Data

Let’s practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.

Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

* `trips`: trips information
* `riders`: user data
* `cars`: autonomous cars

---

Step 1: Let’s examine the three tables

`trips` table:

---

`riders` table:

---

`riders2` table:

---

`cars`: autonomous cars

What are the column names?

HINT:

`trips` table

* `id` - trip ID
* `date` - trip date
* `pickup` - pickup time stamp
* `dropoff` - drop-off time stamp
* `rider_id` - user ID
* `car_id` - car ID
* `type` - type of trip (X, POOL, XL)
* `cost` - trip cost

`riders` table

* `id` - user ID
* `first` - user first name
* `last` - user last name
* `username` - user handle
* `rating` - user average rating
* `total_trips` - total rides ridden
* `referred` - referred by (user ID)

`cars` table

* `id` - car ID
* `model` - car model
* `OS` - operating system
* `status` - active or maintenance
* `trips_completed` - total trips completed


---

Step 2: 

* What’s the primary key of `trips`?
* What’s the primary key of `riders`?
* What’s the primary key of `cars`?

Answer: 

* The primary key of `trips` is `id`.
* The primary key of `riders` is `id`.
* The primary key of `cars` is `id`.

They have the same name, but they are very different.

---

Step 3: Try out a simple cross join between `riders` and `cars`.

Is the result useful?

Answer:

HINT:

Suppose these are the three columns we select:

```sql
SELECT riders.first,
   riders.last,
   cars.model
FROM riders, cars;
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212361226-b0887f86-1b8f-4549-b886-333e190bbd6b.png)


The result combines each user with every car model. Not so useful.

---

Step 4: Suppose we want to create a Trip Log with the trips and its users.

Find the columns to join between `trips` and `riders` and combine the two tables using a `LEFT JOIN`.

Let `trips` be the left table.

Answer: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212362093-5575d019-f454-43a9-b5ef-f0d98500b8d7.png)

```sql
-- Step 4: 
SELECT * FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;
```

HINT:

If we LEFT JOIN on trips.rider_id and riders.id:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders 
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;
```

The result has a lot of columns. 

Suppose, we only want certain columns:

```sql
SELECT trips.date, trips.pickup, trips.dropoff, trips.type,trips.cost, riders.first, riders.last, riders.username
FROM trips 
LEFT JOIN riders ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;
```

---

Step 5: Suppose we want to create a link between the `trips` and the `cars` used during those trips.

Find the columns to join on and combine the `trips` and `cars` table using an `INNER JOIN`.

ANSWER:

HINT:

For `INNER JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM trips
JOIN cars ON trips.car_id = cars.id;
```

The `JOIN` keyword can also be INNER JOIN.

Step 6: The new riders data are in! There are three new users this month.

Stack the riders table on top of the new table named riders2.

Answer:

```sql
-- Step 6: 
SELECT * FROM riders
UNION
SELECT * FROM riders2;
```
HINT:

For stacking one dataset on top of another, we use `UNION`:

# Bonus: Queries and Aggregates

Step 7: 

What is the average `cost` for a trip?

Answer: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212365492-ff76f98c-3689-4b36-8659-a7c9934d6476.png)

HINT:

The result is 31.915

If we use the ROUND() function to round the result to 2 decimal places:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(cost), 2)
FROM trips;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212365662-323dcf62-82de-495e-b1dc-2690e0018ffd.png)

The average cost is $31.92!

Step 8: Lyft is looking to do an email campaign for all the irregular users.

Find all the riders who have used Lyft less than 500 times!

Answer: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212366242-ac363466-f766-4147-bd91-9421307194e5.png)

HINT:

If we are only searching within the riders table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM riders
WHERE total_trips < 500;
```

If we want to search in both `riders` and `riders2`, then we might have to do something like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM riders
WHERE total_trips < 500
UNION
SELECT *
FROM riders2
WHERE total_trips < 500;
```

Step 9: Calculate the number of `cars` that are `active`.

Answer:

```sql
-- Step 9: 
SELECT (*)
FROM cars
WHERE status = 'active';
```
