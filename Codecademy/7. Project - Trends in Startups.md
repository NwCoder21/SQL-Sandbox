Step 1: Getting started, take a look at the startups table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM startups;
```

How many columns are there?

The startups table has ten columns:

* name
* location
* category
* employees
* raised
* valuation
* founded
* stage
* ceo
* info

---

Step 2: Calculate the total number of companies in the table.

There are 70 companies in the table.

---

Step 3:  We want to know the total value of all companies in this table. Calculate this by getting the SUM() of the valuation column.

The sum is $974,455,790,000!

---

Step 4: What is the highest amount raised by a startup? Return the maximum amount of money raised.

---

Step 5: Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.

---

Step 6: In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?

---

### Let's find out the valuations among different sectors:

---

Step 7: Return the average valuation.

---

Step 8: Return the average valuation, in each category.

```sql
SELECT category,AVG(valuation)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1;
```

---

Step 9: Return the average valuation, in each category.
Round the averages to two decimal places.

```sql
SELECT category,ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1;
```

---

Step 10: Return the average valuation, in each category. Round the averages to two decimal places.Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.

Health Care startups seem to have higher valuations than other categories.

---

### What are the most competitive markets?

---

Step 11: First, return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.

---

Step 12: Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them. What are the most competitive markets?

Because you are filtering on a condition that has an aggregate function, you need to use HAVING instead of WHERE:

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

If you want to go a step further, sort the result using ORDER BY:

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

The most competitive markets are:

* Social
* Mobile
* Education

### Let's see if there's a difference in startups sizes among different locations:

---

Step 13: What is the average size of a startup in each location?

---

Step 14: What is the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500?
