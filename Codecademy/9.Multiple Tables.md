# Multiple Tables

# Introduction

In order to efficiently store data, we often spread related information across multiple tables.

For instance, imagine that we’re running a magazine company where users can have different types of subscriptions to different products. Different subscriptions might have many different properties. Each customer would also have lots of associated information.

We could have one table with all of the following information:

* order_id
* customer_id
* customer_name
* customer_address
* subscription_id
* subscription_description
* subscription_monthly_price
* subscription_length
* purchase_date

However, a lot of this information would be repeated. If the same customer has multiple subscriptions, that customer’s name and address will be reported multiple times. If the same subscription type is ordered by multiple customers, then the subscription price and subscription description will be repeated. This will make our table big and unmanageable.

So instead, we can split our data into three tables:

1. orders would contain just the information necessary to describe what was ordered:

    order_id, customer_id, subscription_id, purchase_date

2. subscriptions would contain the information to describe each type of subscription:

    subscription_id, description, price_per_month, subscription_length

3. customers would contain the information for each customer:

    customer_id, customer_name, address

In this lesson, we’ll learn the SQL commands that will help us work with data that is stored in multiple tables.

# Practise 

Examine these tables by pasting the following code into the editor:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 5;
 
SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 5;
 
SELECT * 
FROM customers
LIMIT 5;
```

# Combining Tables Manually

Let’s return to our magazine company. Suppose we have the three tables described in the previous exercise – shown in the browser on the right (we are going to try something new!):

* orders
* subscriptions
* customers

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211784701-cfef2a7b-b24d-4299-ae48-20d9061da03a.png)


If we just look at the orders table, we can’t really tell what’s happened in each order. However, if we refer to the other tables, we can get a complete picture.

Let’s examine the order with an order_id of 2. It was purchased by the customer with a customer_id of 2.

To find out the customer’s name, we look at the customers table and look for the item with a customer_id value of 2. We can see that Customer 2’s name is ‘Jane Doe’ and that she lives at ‘456 Park Ave’.

Doing this kind of matching is called joining two tables.

# Instructions

Step 1: Using the tables displayed, what is the description of the magazine ordered in order_id 1?

Type your answer on line 1 of the code editor.

Be sure to capitalize it the same as in the table.

Answer: Sports Magazine

HINT:

First, we look at the orders table.

The order with an order_id of 1 is in the first row. Its subscription_id is 3.

Then we look at the subscriptions table.

The subscription with a subscription_id of 3 is in the third row. Its description is Sports Magazine.

Answer: Sports Magazine

Don’t write a query for this exercise!

Step 2: Using the tables displayed, what is the customer_name of the customer in order_id 3?

Be sure to capitalize it the same as in the table.

# Combining Tables with SQL

Combining tables manually is time-consuming. Luckily, SQL gives us an easy sequence for this: it’s called a JOIN.

If we want to combine orders and customers, we would type:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

Let’s break down this command:

 * The first line selects all columns from our combined table. If we only want to select certain columns, we can specify which ones we want.
 * The second line specifies the first table that we want to look in, orders
 * The third line uses `JOIN` to say that we want to combine information from orders with customers.
 * The fourth line tells us how to combine the two tables. We want to match orders table’s customer_id column with customers table’s customer_id column.

Because column names are often repeated across multiple tables, we use the syntax `table_name.column_name` to be sure that our requests for columns are unambiguous. In our example, we use this syntax in the `ON` statement, but we will also use it in the SELECT or any other statement where we refer to column names.

For example: Instead of selecting all the columns using `*`, if we only wanted to select orders table’s order_id column and customers table’s customer_name column, we could use the following query:

```sql
SELECT orders.order_id,
   customers.customer_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers
```

# Practise 

Join orders table and subscriptions table and select all columns.

Make sure to join on the `subscription_id` column.

Answer:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211807964-05967437-5ed7-4f59-8b71-e82d76bf53a1.png)


HINT:
Suppose we do:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;
 
SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 10;
```

You will notice that both orders table and subscriptions table have a subscription_id column.

And we want to match these two columns:

* orders.subscription_id
* subscriptions.subscription_id

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
  ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;
```

Notice that in the column `subscriptions.subscription_id`, the table name has a ‘s’ in the end.

Important: only include the first query to pass checkpoint 1.

---

Step 2: Don’t remove the previous query.

Add a second query after your first one that only selects rows from the join where description is equal to ‘Fashion Magazine’.

Answer:

HINT:
The WHERE clause goes after the JOIN!

Answer:

```sql
-- Checkpoint 1
 
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
  ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;
 
-- Checkpoint 2
 
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
  ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id
WHERE subscriptions.description = 'Fashion Magazine';
```

What is the difference between the two result tables?

# Inner Joins

Let’s revisit how we joined orders and customers. For every possible value of `customer_id` in orders, there was a corresponding row of customers with the same `customer_id`.

What if that wasn’t true?

For instance, imagine that our customers table was out of date, and was missing any information on customer 11. If that customer had an order in orders, what would happen when we joined the tables?

When we perform a simple JOIN (often called an inner join) our result only includes rows that match our ON condition.

Consider the following animation, which illustrates an inner join of two tables on `table1.c2 = table2.c2`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211809145-056b4e8c-c2f0-4ad7-9a47-7c0f5c037d0b.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211809208-0133fcae-908c-424d-8787-ca831c42a810.png)

The first and last rows have matching values of `c2`. The middle rows do not match. The final result has all values from the first and last rows but does not include the non-matching middle row.

# Practise 

Step 1: 

Suppose we are working for The Codecademy Times, a newspaper with two types of subscriptions:

* print newspaper
* online articles

Some users subscribe to just the newspaper, some subscribe to just the online edition, and some subscribe to both.

There is a newspaper table that contains information about the newspaper subscribers.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211809823-e1d17f53-f1bf-4d9e-a4c1-7001c18cb555.png)

Count the number of subscribers who get a print newspaper using COUNT().

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211810318-3f4250ae-78b4-4183-bc39-6be9a7141257.png)

HINT:

Use COUNT(*) to count all rows of a table:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper;
```

---

Step 2: Don’t remove your previous query.

There is also an online table that contains information about the online subscribers.

Count the number of subscribers who get an online newspaper using COUNT().

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211810749-c6ca6f2c-c216-4d6e-be00-f9929b5679c2.png)

HINT:

Use COUNT(*) to count all rows of a table:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM online;
```

---

Step 3: Don’t remove your previous queries.

Join newspaper table and online table on their id columns (the unique ID of the subscriber).

How many rows are in this table?

Answer:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211818210-5ddc04d9-b931-4905-b07f-b46e018b4804.png)

HINT:

Suppose we do:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM newspaper
LIMIT 10;
 
SELECT *
FROM online
LIMIT 10;
```

You will notice that both newspaper table and online table have an id column.

And we want to match these two columns:

* newspaper.id
* online.id

Your `ON` statement should look like this:

```sql
ON newspaper.id = online.id
```

Remember to use SELECT COUNT(*) to count the rows:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper
JOIN online
  ON newspaper.id = online.id;
```

---

# Left Joins

What if we want to combine two tables and keep some of the un-matched rows?

SQL lets us do this through a command called `LEFT JOIN`. A left join will keep all rows from the first table, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the second table.

Consider the following animation:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211818681-41cda2b4-29f6-4442-acd4-e22dc30edda9.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211818893-1b011501-a1cd-4b15-9aea-12e82afcff9c.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211819205-f5dcdcdd-c774-4402-ac3d-7e3f11aa6806.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211819279-7e56d454-92fc-4e95-aea2-825122b20a96.png)


The first and last rows have matching values of c2. The middle rows do not match. The final result will keep all rows of the first table but will omit the un-matched row from the second table.

This animation represents a table operation produced by the following command:

```
SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
  ON table1.c2 = table2.c2;
```

* The first line selects all columns from both tables.
* The second line selects table1 (the “left” table).
* The third line performs a `LEFT JOIN` on table2 (the “right” table).
* The fourth line tells SQL how to perform the join (by looking for matching values in column c2).

# Practise 

Step 1: Let’s return to our `newspaper` and `online` subscribers.

Suppose we want to know how many users subscribe to the print newspaper, but not to the online.

Start by performing a left join of `newspaper` table and `online` table on their `id` columns and selecting all columns.


LEFT JOIN online ON newspaper.id = online.id;

newspaper table: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211820469-f348c106-38e9-49e3-9764-b695d84eb798.png)

online table:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211820553-cc43af07-a559-4577-869e-a4a3f93c37e1.png)

---

Step 2: 

Don’t remove your previous query.

In order to find which users do not subscribe to the online edition, we need to add a WHERE clause.

Add a second query after your first one that adds the following WHERE clause and condition:

```sql
WHERE online.id IS NULL
```

This will select rows where there was no corresponding row from the online table.

HINT: 
Add the second query so you can compare the results!

The second query should look like:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM newspaper
LEFT JOIN online
  ON newspaper.id = online.id
WHERE online.id IS NULL;
```

Remember, `WHERE` clause goes after the LEFT JOIN.
