# Project - New York Restaurants


We have put together a table of restaurants called `nomnom` and we need your help to answer some questions. Use the SQL commands you just learned and find the best dinner spots in the city.

The schema of this table is:

Let’s begin!

---

Step 1: 

Start by getting a feel for the nomnom table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM nomnom;
```

What are the column names?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210544011-5cdee42f-4fda-4fef-8260-b905372ccbd6.png)

The column names are:

* name
* neighborhood
* cuisine
* review
* price
* health

---

Step 2: What are the distinct neighborhoods?

The neighborhoods are:

* Brooklyn
* Midtown
* Chinatown
* Uptown
* Queens
* Downtown

---

Step 3: What are the distinct cuisine types?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210545516-42828aa2-67f7-42b0-b3b0-cee1aa67f648.png)

The cuisine types are:

* Steak
* Korean
* Chinese
* Pizza
* Ethiopian
* Vegetarian
* Italian
* Japanese
* American
* Mediterranean
* Indian
* Soul Food
* Mexican

---

Step 4: Suppose we would like some Chinese takeout What are our options?

---

Step 5: Return all the restaurants with reviews of 4 and above.

---

Step 6: Suppose Abbi and Ilana want to have a fancy dinner date. Return all the restaurants that are Italian and $$$.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210546673-80f9282e-c2a3-45ec-9d61-61804447e501.png)

If you want to find Italian restaurants with exactly three dollar signs:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Italian'
   AND price = '$$$';
```

If you want to find Italian restaurants with at least three dollar signs:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Italian'
   AND price LIKE '%$$$%';
```

---

Step 7: Your coworker Trey can’t remember the exact name of a restaurant he went to but he knows it contains the word ‘meatball’ in it. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210546984-7a774997-7a4d-4695-af69-7122b6248ec4.png)

`%` is a wildcard character that matches zero or more missing letters in the pattern.

To find the restaurant names that contain the word ‘meatball’:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE name LIKE '%meatball%';
```

---

Step 8: Let’s order delivery to the house!

Find all the close by spots in Midtown, Downtown or Chinatown.

(`OR` can be used more than once)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210547419-adf5d93a-47f1-4550-b631-eafd536cc0b1.png)

We can use the `OR` operators to combine these conditions:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE neighborhood = 'Midtown'
   OR neighborhood = 'Downtown'
   OR neighborhood = 'Chinatown'; 
```

Here, we have three conditions:

* neighborhood = 'Midtown'
* neighborhood = 'Downtown'
* neighborhood = 'Chinatown'

---

Step 9: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210547734-0cae6805-94fb-402c-a524-a56dcf8a24a3.png)

Empty values are indicated by `IS NULL`.

---

Step 10: Create a Top 10 Restaurants Ranking based on reviews.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210547920-883547df-e4bf-43aa-b92b-7da8a2f64e8b.png)

Using `ORDER BY` and the `DESC` keyword, we can sort the restaurants by ratings from highest to lowest:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
ORDER BY review DESC;
```

Then, include a LIMIT to cap it at 10:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
ORDER BY review DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

Step 11

Use a CASE statement to change the rating system to:

    review > 4.5 is Extraordinary
    review > 4 is Excellent
    review > 3 is Good
    review > 2 is Fair
    Everything else is Poor

Don’t forget to rename the new column!

Here, the column is renamed to ‘Review’ using `AS`.
