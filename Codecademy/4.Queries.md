# Queries

# Introduction

Here, will cover SQL commands to query a single table in a database.

One of the core purposes of the SQL language is to retrieve information stored in a database. This is commonly referred to as **querying**.
Queries allow us to communicate with the database by asking questions and returning a result set with data relevant to the question. 

We will be querying a database with one table named `movies`. The columns for this table are `id`, `name`, `genre`, `year`, and `imdb_rating`.

When we run `SELECT * FROM movies`, this is what we will see:

This is the whole table.

# `SELECT`

Previously, we learned that `SELECT` is used every time you want to query data from a database and `*` means all columns.

What if we are only intrested in two columns. We can select individual columns by their names (separated by a comma):

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name;
```

To make it easier to read, we moved FROM to another line.

Line breaks don’t mean anything specific in SQL. We could write this entire query in one line, and it would run just fine. 

# Practise 

1. Let’s only select the name and genre columns of the table. In the code editor, type the following:

```sql
SELECT name, genre 
FROM movies;
```

> SELECT and FROM are clauses. Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208632033-00c32db6-6733-4748-a9b5-35a835a7fdbd.png)

---

-- Step 2: Now we want to include a third column. Edit your query so that it returns the name, genre, and year columns of the table. 

```sql
SELECT name, genre, year FROM movies;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208632157-dc3e83f0-d4d9-44ab-b276-7425899088ab.png)

---

Tip: The syntax for selecting three individual columns:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table_name;
```

* We have to separate the column names with a comma.
* SQL commands end with a `;`.

---

# `AS`

The code below:

```sql
SELECT name AS 'Titles'
FROM movies;
```

`AS` is a keyword in SQL that allows you to **rename** a column or table using an alias. The new name can be anything you want as long as you put it **inside of single quotes**. Here we renamed the name column as Titles.

Some important things to note:

* Although it’s not always necessary, it’s best practice to surround your aliases with single quotes.
* When using `AS`, the columns are not being renamed in the table. The aliases only appear in the result.

---

# Practise 

Step 1: To showcase what the AS keyword does, select the name column and rename it with an alias of your choosing. Place the alias inside single quotes, like so:

```sql
SELECT name AS '______'
FROM movies;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208634565-9582d47b-a592-4192-828c-25c01063ec56.png)

---

Step 2: Edit the query so that instead of selecting and renaming the name column, select the imdb_rating column and rename it as IMDb.

```sql
SELECT imdb_rating AS 'IMDb' FROM movies;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208634869-e2c4fd7c-77ca-4eff-b30f-40bdb827422c.png)

---

Tip: The `AS` syntax is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column AS 'Nickname' 
FROM table_name;
```

Put single quotes around the alias.

Suppose you want to rename the name column as Binge, then the query would look like:

```sql
SELECT name AS 'Binge' 
FROM movies;
```

---

# `DISTINCT`

When we are examining data in a table, it can be helpful to know what distinct values exist in a particular column. DISTINCT is used to return unique values in the output. It filters out all duplicate values in the specified column(s). For instance,

```sql
SELECT tools 
FROM inventory;
```

might produce:

```yaml
tools
Hammer
Nails
Nails
Nails
```

By adding `DISTINCT` before the column name,

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT tools 
FROM inventory;
```

Filtering the results of a query is an important skill in SQL. It is easier to see the different possible genres in the movie table after the data has been filtered than to scan every row in the table.

---

# Practise 


Step 1: output all **unique** genres in the `movies` table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movies;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208636390-755440ee-f8e7-4295-8ce7-4f46b209f54a.png)

The different genres are:

* action
* comedy
* horror
* romance
* drama
* ∅

The empty set symbol ∅ is just an empty value. DISTINCT recognize empty values, too.

---

Step 2: Now, change the code so we return the unique values of the year column instead.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT year FROM movies;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208636636-ab8fb17c-c01a-4bc1-a615-2dd0f8726a2d.png)

Tip: Suppose we only want to query the distinct results from a column. We will use the syntax:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column
FROM table_name;
```
Note: You might’ve noticed how there appears to be an empty set symbol ∅ near the bottom of the results (right below 1987 and above 2017). It is not a bug! `DISTINCT` recognize empty values, too.

---

# `WHERE`

We can **restrict our query** results using the WHERE clause in order to obtain only the information we want. Following this format, the statement below filters the result set to only include top rated movies (IMDb ratings greater than 8):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE imdb_rating > 8;
```

1. The `WHERE` clause filters the result set to only include rows where the following condition is true.

2. imdb_rating > 8 is the condition. Here, only rows with a value greater than 8 in the imdb_rating column will be returned.

The `>` is an operator. Operators create a condition that can be evaluated as either _true_ or _false_.

Comparison operators used with the WHERE clause are:

* `=` equal to
* `!=` not equal to
* `>` greater than
* `<` less than
* `>=` greater than or equal to
* `<=` less than or equal to

---

# Practise 

1. Output all movies with a IMDb rating of less than 5

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE imdb_rating < 5; 
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208638309-e329e2c7-597d-43d5-a383-7849047101f3.png)

Tip: We are trying to retrieve all the movies with ratings lower than 5.

Common errors:

* Missing underscore in the imdb_rating column name. 
* Missing `;` at the end.

---

Step 2: Edit the query so that it will now retrieve all the recent movies, specifically those that were released after 2014.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE year > 2014;
```
Tip: The condition here would be `year > 2014`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208639122-8d257063-a731-44ae-b091-9c372879d5f0.png)

# `LIKE` Part 1

`LIKE` can be a useful operator when you want to compare similar values.

The movies table contains two films with similar titles, ‘Se7en’ and ‘Seven’.

How could we select all movies that start with ‘Se’ and end with ‘en’ and have exactly one character in the middle?

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en';
```


* `LIKE` is a special operator used with the `WHERE` clause to search for a specific pattern in a column.

* `name LIKE 'Se_en'` is a condition evaluating the name column for a specific pattern.

* `Se_en` represents a pattern with a wildcard character.

The `_` means you can substitute any individual character here without breaking the pattern. The names Seven and Se7en both match this pattern.

---

# Practise 

Let’s test it out.
In the code editor, type:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en';
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210526751-cc6eae59-6799-4c8b-bb8e-da859e1c09d5.png)

---

# Like II

The percentage sign `%` is another wildcard character that can be used with LIKE.

This statement below filters the result set to only include movies with names that begin with the letter ‘A’:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

`%` is a wildcard character that matches zero or more missing letters in the pattern. For example:

`A%` matches all movies with names that begin with letter ‘A’
`%a` matches all movies that end with ‘a’

We can also use % both before and after a pattern:

```
SELECT * 
FROM movies 
WHERE name LIKE '%man%';
```

Here, any movie that contains the word ‘man’ in its name will be returned in the result.

`LIKE` is not case sensitive. ‘Batman’ and ‘Man of Steel’ will both appear in the result of the query above.

---

# Practise 

Step 1: 

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE '%man%';
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210527887-ef855b8c-09d9-4a81-a79a-ccb21145097a.png)

How many movie titles contain the word ‘man’?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210527448-1a7a2727-8f9f-4853-9795-867ff8b306aa.png)

---

Step 2: 

Edit the query so that it selects all the information about the movie titles that begin with the word ‘The’.

You might need a space in there!

```sql
-- Step 2: 
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'The %';
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210528104-1ebc53a1-15b5-4dea-a531-55fed73f17d1.png)

---

# Is Null

Unknown values are indicated by `NULL` in the table.

It is not possible to test for `NULL` values with comparison operators, such as `=` and `!=`.

Instead, we will have to use these operators:

* `IS NULL`
* `IS NOT NULL`

To filter for all movies with an IMDb rating:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM movies 
WHERE imdb_rating IS NOT NULL;
```

# Between

The `BETWEEN` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to filter the result set within a certain range. It accepts two values that are either numbers, text or dates.

For example, this statement filters the result set to only include movies with years from 1990 up to, and including 1999.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999;
```

When the values are text, `BETWEEN` filters the result set for within the alphabetical range.

In this statement, `BETWEEN` filters the result set to only include movies with names that begin with the letter ‘A’ up to, but not including ones that begin with ‘J’.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J';
```

However, if a movie has a name of simply ‘J’, it would actually match. This is because BETWEEN goes up to the second value — up to ‘J’. So the movie named ‘J’ would be included in the result set but not ‘Jaws’.

BETWEEN 'D' AND 'G' should be the condition.

This will return all the names that begin with ‘D’, ‘E’, and ‘F’.

`BETWEEN 'D' AND 'F'` should not be the condition because it would return names that begin with ‘D’ and ‘E’, but not ‘F’ (unless there was a movie with the single letter name of “F”).

And don’t forget to capitalize D and G!

`BETWEEN` is case-sensitive. If the condition is `BETWEEN 'a' AND 'z'`, it would only return lowercase (a-z) results and not uppercase (A-Z).

In this statement, the BETWEEN operator is being used to filter the result set to only include movies with years in 1970-1979:

Remember, `BETWEEN` two numbers is inclusive of the second number.

Notice that there is a movie from 1979 in the result.

Also, numeric values (INTEGER or REAL data types) don’t need to be wrapped with single quotes, whereas TEXT values do.

---

# And

Sometimes we want to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause to make the result set more specific and useful.

One way of doing this is to use the `AND` operator. Here, we use the `AND` operator to only return 90’s romance movies.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999
   AND genre = 'romance';
```

* year `BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999` is the 1st condition.
* `genre = 'romance'` is the 2nd condition.
* `AND` combines the two conditions.

With `AND`, both conditions must be true for the row to be included in the result.

We are putting AND imdb_rating > 8 on another line and indented just so it is easier to read.

The two conditions are: 

* year < 1985
* genre = 'horror'

Also, numeric values (1985) don’t need to be wrapped with single quotes, whereas string values do ('horror').

---

# OR

Similar to `AND`, the `OR` operator can also be used to combine multiple conditions in `WHERE`, but there is a fundamental difference:

* `AND` operator displays a row if all the conditions are true. 
* `OR` operator displays a row if any condition is true.

Suppose we want to check out a new movie or something action-packed:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year > 2014
   OR genre = 'action';
```

* `year > 2014` is the 1st condition.
* `genre = 'action'` is the 2nd condition.
* `OR` combines the two conditions.

With `OR`, if any of the conditions are true, then the row is added to the result.

This retrieves all the movies released after 2014 or in the action genre.

We are putting `OR genre = 'action'` on another line just so it is easier to read.

The two conditions are: 

* genre = 'romance'
* genre = 'comedy'

# Order By

That’s it with `WHERE` and its operators. Moving on!

It is often useful to list the data in our result set in a particular order.

We can sort the results using `ORDER BY`, either alphabetically or numerically. Sorting the results often makes the data more useful and easier to analyze.

For example, if we want to sort everything by the movie’s title from A through Z:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies
ORDER BY name;
```
* `ORDER BY` is a clause that indicates you want to sort the result set by a particular column.
* `name` is the specified column.

Sometimes we want to sort things in a decreasing order. For example, if we want to select all of the well-received movies, sorted from highest to lowest by their year:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE imdb_rating > 8
ORDER BY year DESC;
```

* `DESC` is a keyword used in ORDER BY to sort the results in descending order (high to low or Z-A).
* `ASC` is a keyword used in ORDER BY to sort the results in ascending order (low to high or A-Z).

The column that we `ORDER BY` doesn’t even have to be one of the columns that we’re displaying.

Note: `ORDER BY` always goes after `WHERE` (if WHERE is present).

We didn’t add ASC here because ascending order is the default.

If you run this code, the result will start with ‘1408’, ‘3 Men and a Baby’ and then A-Z.

We added DESC here because we want to sort it in a descending order.

If you run this query, the result will start with movies with an IMDb rating of 9.0 all the way down to 4.2.

---

# Limit

We’ve been working with a fairly small table (fewer than 250 rows), but most SQL tables contain hundreds of thousands of records. In those situations, it becomes important to cap the number of rows in the result.

For instance, imagine that we just want to see a few examples of records.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies
LIMIT 10;
```

`LIMIT` is a clause that lets you specify the maximum number of rows the result set will have. This saves space on our screen and makes our queries run faster.

Here, we specify that the result set can’t have more than 10 rows.

`LIMIT` always goes at the very end of the query. Also, it is not supported in all SQL databases.

If you run this query, the result will be ‘The Dark Knight’ at an impressive 9.0, ‘Inception’ and ‘Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back’ tying for second with a rating of 8.8.

---

# Case

A `CASE` statement allows us to create different outputs (usually in the SELECT statement). It is SQL’s way of handling if-then logic.

Suppose we want to condense the ratings in movies to three levels:

* If the rating is above 8, then it is Fantastic.
* If the rating is above 6, then it is Poorly Received.
* Else, Avoid at All Costs.

```
SELECT name,
 CASE
  WHEN imdb_rating > 8 THEN 'Fantastic'
  WHEN imdb_rating > 6 THEN 'Poorly Received'
  ELSE 'Avoid at All Costs'
 END
FROM movies;
```
    
* Each `WHEN` tests a condition and the following `THEN` gives us the string if the condition is true.
* The `ELSE` gives us the string if all the above conditions are false.
* The `CASE` statement must end with END.

In the result, you have to scroll right because the column name is very long. To shorten it, we can rename the column to ‘Review’ using `AS`:

```sql
SELECT name,
 CASE
  WHEN imdb_rating > 8 THEN 'Fantastic'
  WHEN imdb_rating > 6 THEN 'Poorly Received'
  ELSE 'Avoid at All Costs'
 END AS 'Review'
FROM movies;
```

* If the genre is romance, then it is Chill.
* If the genre is comedy, then it is Chill.
* Else, it is Intense.

Don’t forget the comma after name.

Here is another query that will give us the same result:

```sql
SELECT name,
 CASE
  WHEN genre = 'romance' OR genre = 'comedy' 
   THEN 'Chill'
  ELSE 'Intense'
 END AS 'Mood'
FROM movies;
```
   
* If the genre is romance or comedy, then it is Chill.
* Else, it is Intense.

# Review

We just learned how to query data from a database using SQL. We also learned how to filter queries to make the information more specific and useful.

Let’s summarize:

* `SELECT` is the clause we use every time we want to query information from a database.
* `AS` renames a column or table.
* `DISTINCT` return unique values.
* `WHERE` is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
* `LIKE` and `BETWEEN` are special operators.
* `AND` and `OR` combines multiple conditions.
* `ORDER BY` sorts the result.
* `LIMIT` specifies the maximum number of rows that the query will return.
* `CASE` creates different outputs.
