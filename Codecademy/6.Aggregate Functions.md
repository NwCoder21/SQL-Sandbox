# Aggregate Functions

# Introduction

Weâ€™ve learned how to write queries to retrieve information from the database. Now, we are going to learn how to perform calculations using SQL.

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.

In this lesson, we have given you a table named fake_apps which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates that we will cover in the next five exercises:

* `COUNT()`: count the number of rows
* `SUM()`: the sum of the values in a column
* `MAX()`/`MIN()`: the largest/smallest value
* `AVG()`: the average of the values in a column
* `ROUND()`: round the values in the column

Before getting started, take a look at the data in the fake_apps table.

In the code editor, type the following:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM fake_apps;
```

The column names are:
