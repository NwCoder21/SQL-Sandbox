# Aggregate Functions

# Introduction

We’ve learned how to write queries to retrieve information from the database. Now, we are going to learn how to perform calculations using SQL.

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.

In this lesson, we have given you a table named fake_apps which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates that we will cover in the next five exercises:

* `COUNT()`: count the number of rows
* `SUM()`: the sum of the values in a column
* `MAX()`/`MIN()`: the largest/smallest value
* `AVG()`: the average of the values in a column
* `ROUND()`: round the values in the column

Before getting started, take a look at the data in the fake_apps table.

In the code editor, type the following:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM fake_apps;
```

What are the column names?

The column names are:

* `id`
* `name`
* `category`
* `downloads`
* `price`

# Count

The fastest way to calculate how many rows are in a table is to use the `COUNT()` function.

`COUNT()` is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;

Here, we want to count every row, so we pass * as an argument inside the parenthesis.

# Practise 

Step 1: Let’s count how many apps are in the table.

There are 200 apps.

Common errors:

* Missing parenthesis.
* Missing ;.

---

Step 2: Add a WHERE clause in the previous query to count how many free apps are in the table.

Remember the `WHERE` statement?

The following code should go inside the previous query, before the semicolon:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM fake_apps
WHERE price = 0;
```

* `WHERE` indicates we want to only include rows where the following condition is true.
* `price = 0` is the condition.

There are 73 free apps in the table.

# Sum

SQL makes it easy to add all values in a particular column using `SUM()`.

`SUM()` is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.

What is the total number of downloads for all of the apps combined?

```sql
SELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

This adds all values in the downloads column.

# Practise 

-- Step 1: Let’s find out the total number of downloads for all of the apps combined?

There are 3,322,760 total downloads.

---

# Max / Min

The `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.

How many downloads does the most popular app have?

```sql
SELECT MAX(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

The most popular app has 31,090 downloads!

`MAX()` takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the largest value in that column. Here, we returned the largest value in the downloads column.

`MIN()` works the same way but it does the exact opposite; it returns the smallest value.

# Practise 

Step 1: What is the least number of times an app has been downloaded?

1,387 downloads.
