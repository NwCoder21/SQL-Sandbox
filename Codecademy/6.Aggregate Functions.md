# Aggregate Functions

# Introduction

We’ve learned how to write queries to retrieve information from the database. Now, we are going to learn how to perform calculations using SQL.

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.

In this lesson, we have given you a table named fake_apps which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates that we will cover in the next five exercises:

* `COUNT()`: count the number of rows
* `SUM()`: the sum of the values in a column
* `MAX()`/`MIN()`: the largest/smallest value
* `AVG()`: the average of the values in a column
* `ROUND()`: round the values in the column

---

Before getting started, take a look at the data in the fake_apps table.

In the code editor, type the following:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM fake_apps;
```

---

What are the column names?

The column names are:

* `id`
* `name`
* `category`
* `downloads`
* `price`

---

# Count

The fastest way to calculate how many rows are in a table is to use the `COUNT()` function.

`COUNT()` is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;

Here, we want to count every row, so we pass * as an argument inside the parenthesis.

---

# Practise 

Step 1: Let’s count how many apps are in the table.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210769696-cd10cdee-774c-478c-a66f-a9f8b8f0a5c8.png)

There are 200 apps.

Common errors:

* Missing parenthesis.
* Missing ;.

---

Step 2: Add a WHERE clause in the previous query to count how many free apps are in the table.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210769965-2efc8fa0-4912-4a7d-8437-65ca17696ff8.png)

Remember the `WHERE` statement?

The following code should go inside the previous query, before the semicolon:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM fake_apps
WHERE price = 0;
```

* `WHERE` indicates we want to only include rows where the following condition is true.
* `price = 0` is the condition.

There are 73 free apps in the table.

---

# Sum

SQL makes it easy to add all values in a particular column using `SUM()`.

`SUM()` is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.

What is the total number of downloads for all of the apps combined?

```sql
SELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

This adds all values in the downloads column.

---

# Practise 

-- Step 1: Let’s find out the total number of downloads for all of the apps combined?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210770642-e4d7bd85-b543-4d17-85fe-b774922cf3a3.png)

There are 3,322,760 total downloads.

---

# Max / Min

The `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.

How many downloads does the most popular app have?

```sql
SELECT MAX(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

The most popular app has 31,090 downloads!

`MAX()` takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the largest value in that column. Here, we returned the largest value in the downloads column.

`MIN()` works the same way but it does the exact opposite; it returns the smallest value.

---

# Practise 

Step 1: What is the least number of times an app has been downloaded?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210771063-49a104b3-8db8-4a48-b727-b9f6c4ee53a4.png)

1,387 downloads.

---

Step 2: Write a new query that returns the price of the most expensive app.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210771299-a1dc6c8a-9bb4-4acc-abbb-e9c13d27b071.png)

$14.99 is the price of the most expensive app.

---

# Average

SQL uses the `AVG()` function to quickly calculate the average value of a particular column.

The statement below returns the average number of downloads for an app in our database:

```sql
SELECT AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

The `AVG()` function works by taking a column name as an argument and returns the average value for that column.

---

# Practise 

Step 1: Calculate the average number of downloads for all the apps in the table

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210772083-e86b5d6f-8ab2-4ff6-9013-d15e9db82340.png)

16,613.8 average downloads.

---

Step 2: Write a new query that calculates the average price for all the apps in the table.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210772278-37772f52-c921-4419-9545-0c682c59a356.png)

The average price is $2.02365.

---

# Round

By default, SQL tries to be as precise as possible without rounding. We can make the result table easier to read using the `ROUND()` function.

`ROUND()` function takes two arguments inside the parenthesis:

* a column name
* an integer

It rounds the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer.

```sql
SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;
```

Here, we pass the column price and integer 0 as arguments. SQL rounds the values in the column to 0 decimal places in the output.

---

# Practise 

Step 1: Let’s return the name column and a rounded price column

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210772851-d4456872-b035-4e09-82f8-abb8c361013e.png)

We are selecting ROUND(price, 0) as the second column in this query.

---

Step 2: In the last exercise, we were able to get the average price of an app ($2.02365) using this query:

```sql
SELECT AVG(price)
FROM fake_apps;
```
Now, let’s edit this query so that it rounds this result to 2 decimal places.

This is a tricky one!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210773497-e8b4aeb7-580a-494c-b388-d795798f0b46.png)

Hint: 

You can treat `AVG(price)` just like any other value and place it inside the `ROUND` function like so:

```sql
ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
```

Here, `AVG(price)` is the 1st argument and 2 is the 2nd argument because we want to round it to two decimal places:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
FROM fake_apps;
```

---

# Group By (Part 1)

Oftentimes, we will want to calculate an aggregate for data with certain characteristics.

For instance, we might want to know the mean IMDb ratings for all movies each year. We could calculate each number by a series of queries with different WHERE statements, like so:

SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 1999;
 
SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 2000;
 
SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 2001;

and so on.

Luckily, there’s a better way!

We can use `GROUP BY` to do this in a single step:

```sql
SELECT year,
   AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;
```

`GROUP BY` is a clause in SQL that is used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the `SELECT` statement to arrange identical data into groups.

The `GROUP BY` statement comes after any `WHERE` statements, but before `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT`.

---

# Practise 

Step 1: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210774382-c84562eb-0e90-420a-84cd-adadaf7007f8.png)

Here, our aggregate function is `COUNT()` and we arranged price into groups.

What do you expect the result to be?

The result contains the total number of apps for each price.

It is organized into two columns, making it very easy to see the number of apps at each price.

---

Step 2: add a WHERE clause to count the total number of apps that have been downloaded more than 20,000 times, at each price.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210774802-b3a64ea9-811d-4ee5-94dd-f0d0be5fa413.png)

```diff
- Remember, WHERE statement goes before the GROUP BY statement:
```

```sql
SELECT price, COUNT(*) 
FROM fake_apps
WHERE downloads > 20000
GROUP BY price;
```

---

Step 3: Write a new query that calculates the total number of downloads for each category. Select category and SUM(downloads).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210775236-9b03e5ec-60ff-407e-ab01-f919b01ec435.png)

First, select the two columns we want:

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

Next, group the result for each category by adding a GROUP BY:

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY category;
```

---

 # Group By (Part 2) 
 
 Sometimes, we want to `GROUP BY` a calculation done on a column.

For instance, we might want to know how many movies have IMDb ratings that round to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We could do this using the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY ROUND(imdb_rating)
ORDER BY ROUND(imdb_rating);
```

However, this query may be time-consuming to write and more prone to error.

SQL lets us use column reference(s) in our GROUP BY that will make our lives easier.

* 1 is the first column selected
* 2 is the second column selected
* 3 is the third column selected

and so on.

The following query is equivalent to the one above:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

Here, the 1 refers to the first column in our SELECT statement, ROUND(imdb_rating).

---

# Practise 

Step 1: Suppose we have the query below:

```
SELECT category, 
   price,
   AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY category, price;
```

Write the exact query, but use column reference numbers instead of column names after GROUP BY.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210784944-1a2586b9-7a6c-4371-898a-ea117f89c41b.png)

Hint: 

These numbers represent the selected columns:

* 1 refers to category.
* 2 refers to price.
* 3 refers to AVG(downloads)

Now, change the GROUP BY with numbers:

```sql
SELECT category, 
   price,
   AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

Note: Even if you use column names instead of numbers, it will still be correct because these two queries are exactly the same!

# Having

In addition to being able to group data using `GROUP BY`, SQL also allows you to filter which groups to include and which to exclude.

For instance, imagine that we want to see how many movies of different genres were produced each year, but we only care about years and genres with at least 10 movies.

We can’t use `WHERE` here because we don’t want to filter the rows; we want to filter groups.

This is where `HAVING` comes in.

`HAVING` is very similar to `WHERE`. In fact, all types of `WHERE` clauses you learned about thus far can be used with `HAVING`.

We can use the following for the problem:

```sql
SELECT year,
   genre,
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(name) > 10;
```

* When we want to limit the results of a query based on values of the individual rows, use WHERE.
* When we want to limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property, use HAVING.

`HAVING` statement always comes after `GROUP BY`, but before `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.

---

# Practise 

Suppose we have the query below:

```sql
SELECT price, 
   ROUND(AVG(downloads)),
   COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price;
```

It returns the average downloads (rounded) and the number of apps – at each price point.

However, certain price points don’t have very many apps, so their average downloads are less meaningful.

Add a `HAVING` clause to restrict the query to price points that have more than 10 apps.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210785673-cb4d2866-8755-43aa-9870-2d8bde15fabb.png)

HINT:
The total number of apps at each price point would be given by COUNT(*).

```sql
SELECT price, 
   ROUND(AVG(downloads)),
   COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

`COUNT(*) > 10` is the condition.

```diff
- Because the condition has an aggregate function in it, we have to use `HAVING` instead of `WHERE`.
```

# Review

You just learned how to use aggregate functions to perform calculations on your data. What can we generalize so far?

* `COUNT()`: count the number of rows 
* `SUM()`: the sum of the values in a column
* `MAX()`/`MIN()`: the largest/smallest value
* `AVG()`: the average of the values in a column
* `ROUND()`: round the values in the column

Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.

* `GROUP BY` is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
* `HAVING` limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property.
