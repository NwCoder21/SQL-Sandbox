# Compraison & Logical Operators

These allow us to string together different queries and make more complex selections. So, rather than having to do two queries, we could put them together.

With our books table, we could make more complex selections like select all books that have a price below $20, and at the samw time, have more than 50 copies in stock.

---

<!-- L 176 - NOT EQUAL --> 

# NOT EQUAL

There are some logical operators that are built into MySQL that help us write more complex queries and more complicated logic. For example:

* Select all items that are in stock AND price below Â£19.99
* Select all books NOT published in 2017 
* Select all birthdays BETWEEN 2000 and 2005.

---

# `!=`

This means NOT EQUAL.

In the above example, we are selecting `title` column from the books table where the year is NOT EQUAL to 2017.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209317093-70086989-ae44-4a6d-b877-3ca240db56a7.png)

Here, are are only selecting entries which were released in 2017.

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released_year = 2017;
```

---

But if we put a `!` before the `=` sign, it now means not equal to 2017. So we'll select any books where release year is anything but 2017...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209317452-9e020fc5-3394-4e4b-af87-8e99bed2d56c.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released_year != 2017;
```

---

Another exampe is where we don't want to output any books writted by the surname Gaiman. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209317956-8252ebc1-deb4-4e23-a51e-0318de51157c.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_lname !='Gaiman';
```

Now we see all the books except those written by Gaiman.

NOTE: `=` and `!=` are COMPARISON operators, not LOGICAL operators.

---

<!-- L 178 - NOT LIKE --> 

# `NOT LIKE`

This is the opposite of `LIKE`. For example if we wanted to find a title name where there is a space, we would use...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209319959-a453cc5c-b56f-4a4e-978e-fa94dc55d954.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '% %';
```
---

However, if we wanted to see the title names which do not have a space, we can use ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209320128-ba6d4094-833b-4807-85f0-db165b8d18da.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title NOT LIKE '% %';
```
We're now selecting all the books where there is no match to this pattern where the title is not like this pattern (`% %`).

--- 

Another example is that we have many author first names which start with `da`. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209320674-0e5bdf49-9dd1-4796-a4b9-3552caa99f9a.png)

```sql
SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname FROM books WHERE author_fname LIKE 'da%';
```

But if we do not want to see those entries where the author's first name starts with `da`, we can use ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209320964-b78a8cb2-ac9f-420c-ba3e-dbfe66f28247.png)

```sql
SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname FROM books WHERE author_fname NOT LIKE 'da%';
```
---

Another example is where we try to only output titles which do not contain the letter `e`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209321230-34421290-10f4-4398-b9fa-ade6da071663.png)

Here, it only outputs titles which have not got an `e` in the title.

```sql
SELECT title FROM books WHERE title NOT LIKE '%e%';
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209325724-6a547ca7-a3b0-47bd-bfe2-ca7f6108f46d.png)

<!-- L 180 - Greater Than --> 

# `>` - Greater Than

This is the next operator we are looking at.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209327586-6f61926c-b403-4b52-b4ca-e8c06115cf49.png)

If we wanted to output all books which were released aftter 2000, we can do the above. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209328603-27b6e3ed-3a2e-4d7e-b5e6-21cf92465020.png)


Here, we are searching for titles which were released after the year 1995.

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released_year > 1995;
```

---

Another example is if we wanted to search for books which contained more than 500 pages ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209328810-3dd7d1d3-95be-40cb-bba9-3f03f4869431.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209329580-5de18ca9-6941-47b9-b124-23b47823db48.png)

What do you think will happen when we run this? 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209329775-6ab20088-d796-4ac8-be79-096f9cf2494f.png)

It evaluates to a number. If the statement is true, it will return a 1 and if the statement is false, it returns 0. Because in the above example 99 is greater than 1, it returns 1.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209329973-0e94747c-16ba-4616-9a36-50d694599e77.png)

Because in this example, 1 is not greater than 99, it returns 0.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209330688-794508f4-5889-4d1e-a31f-fdd8018d4c6f.png)

Here, the SQL evaluates `pages > 500` with each row. If the number of pages is not greater than 500, it returns a 0 and does not include that row in the results and if it gets 1, which means it is true, it includes that row in the results.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209331656-842cd4d4-c0e7-4d46-bd6a-b01772af6ead.png)

When we try to evaluate against `NULL`, we get `NULL` returned as NUll represents a lack of a value. So, how can we compare a number, like 1, to nothingness. 

So just know that you'll always get `NULL` when we try and make these comparisons with `NULL` and some other value.

# `<` - Less Than 

The opposite of `>`, greater than, is `<`, less than.

Let's select all the books released before the year 1995 ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209332624-e4955118-62e8-490f-8d3a-56cc76fb25cf.png)

```sql
SELECT title, released_year FROM books WHERE released_year < 1995;
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209333554-807f6d6c-827e-4bb8-aaa5-1308d701fbb0.png)

We can then sort those results 

```sql
SELECT title, released_year FROM books 
WHERE released_year < 1995
ORDER BY released_year DESC;
```

---

Another example is let's try and find the books which have less than 200 pages ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338011-d6224434-29a1-44ee-8c92-2e63cab7bf47.png)

```sql
SELECT book_id, title, pages FROM books 
WHERE pages < 200;
```

---

# Greater Than or Equal To `>=` and Less Than or Equal to `<=`

This is our table:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338234-75b38ba2-9c69-44aa-be51-c466907d71d6.png)

---

Let's say we want to find all the books released after 2010 but we also want to inlcude the year 2010 in the output results.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338441-5f180bb1-f092-4c8f-8da4-9e2d099617ce.png)

We can do the above, but it won't include any books released in the year 2010, instead, it starts checking from 2011.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338607-0462cb78-4a8b-4b73-a7e1-02974370006c.png)

So, we can do `>=` (greater than or equal to). So now this will include all rows where the value for release year is either 2010 exactly or anything greater than 2010.

---

Same is applied `<=` (less than or equal to). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338805-92b8e06e-7420-4bd3-ad2e-19cfdad9f7d5.png)

Here, `< 1985` starts checking from 1984 and below but does not include the year 1985.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338895-ceef3af7-ae83-4079-bdd2-d5caef7cf24f.png)

Now, the year 1985 is included.

<!-- L184 - Logical AND --> 

# Logical `AND`

So, 

* `<`
* `<=`
* `>`
* `>=`

are comparison operators. They are called this because they compare two values.

Now we will look at logical operators, Logical `AND`, Logical `OR` and Logical `NOT`.

Imagine we wanted to create a query for our books table,
