# Compraison & Logical Operators

These allow us to string together different queries and make more complex selections. So, rather than having to do two queries, we could put them together.

With our books table, we could make more complex selections like select all books that have a price below $20, and at the samw time, have more than 50 copies in stock.

# NOT EQUAL

There are some logical operators that are built into MySQL that help us write more complex queries and more complicated logic. For example:

* Select all items that are in stock AND price below Â£19.99
* Select all books NOT published in 2017 
* Select all birthdays BETWEEN 2000 and 2005.

---

# `!=`

This means NOT EQUAL.

In the above example, we are selecting `title` column from the books table where the year is NOT EQUAL to 2017.

Here, are are only selecting entries which were released in 2017.

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released_year = 2017;
```

---

But if we put a `!` before the `=` sign, it now means not equal to 2017. So we'll select any books where release year is anything but 2017...

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released_year != 2017;
```

---

Another exampe is where we don't want to output any books writted by the surname Gaiman. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209317956-8252ebc1-deb4-4e23-a51e-0318de51157c.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_lname !='Gaiman';
```

Now we see all the books except those written by Gaiman.

NOTE: `=` and `!=` are COMPARISON operators, not LOGICAL operators.
