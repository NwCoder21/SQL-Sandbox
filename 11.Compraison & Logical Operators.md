# Compraison & Logical Operators

These allow us to string together different queries and make more complex selections. So, rather than having to do two queries, we could put them together.

With our books table, we could make more complex selections like select all books that have a price below $20, and at the samw time, have more than 50 copies in stock.

<!-- L 176 - NOT EQUAL --> 

# NOT EQUAL

There are some logical operators that are built into MySQL that help us write more complex queries and more complicated logic. For example:

* Select all items that are in stock AND price below Â£19.99
* Select all books NOT published in 2017 
* Select all birthdays BETWEEN 2000 and 2005.

---

# `!=`

This means NOT EQUAL.

In the above example, we are selecting `title` column from the books table where the year is NOT EQUAL to 2017.

Here, are are only selecting entries which were released in 2017.

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released_year = 2017;
```

---

But if we put a `!` before the `=` sign, it now means not equal to 2017. So we'll select any books where release year is anything but 2017...

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released_year != 2017;
```

---

Another exampe is where we don't want to output any books writted by the surname Gaiman. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209317956-8252ebc1-deb4-4e23-a51e-0318de51157c.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_lname !='Gaiman';
```

Now we see all the books except those written by Gaiman.

NOTE: `=` and `!=` are COMPARISON operators, not LOGICAL operators.

---

<!-- L 178 - NOT LIKE --> 

# `NOT LIKE`

This is the opposite of `LIKE`. For example if we wanted to find a title name where there is a space, we would use...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209319959-a453cc5c-b56f-4a4e-978e-fa94dc55d954.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '% %';
```
---

However, if we wanted to see the title names which do not have a space, we can use ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209320128-ba6d4094-833b-4807-85f0-db165b8d18da.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title NOT LIKE '% %';
```
We're now selecting all the books where there is no match to this pattern where the title is not like this pattern (`% %`).

--- 

Another example is that we have many author first names which start with `da`. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209320674-0e5bdf49-9dd1-4796-a4b9-3552caa99f9a.png)

```sql
SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname FROM books WHERE author_fname LIKE 'da%';
```

But if we do not want to see those entries where the author's first name starts with `da`, we can use ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209320964-b78a8cb2-ac9f-420c-ba3e-dbfe66f28247.png)

```sql
SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname FROM books WHERE author_fname NOT LIKE 'da%';
```
---

Another example is where we try to only output titles which do not contain the letter `e`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209321230-34421290-10f4-4398-b9fa-ade6da071663.png)

Here, it only outputs titles which have not got an `e` in the title.
