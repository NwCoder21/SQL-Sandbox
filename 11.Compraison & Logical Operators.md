# Compraison & Logical Operators

These allow us to string together different queries and make more complex selections. So, rather than having to do two queries, we could put them together.

With our books table, we could make more complex selections like select all books that have a price below $20, and at the samw time, have more than 50 copies in stock.

---

<!-- L 176 - NOT EQUAL --> 

# NOT EQUAL

There are some logical operators that are built into MySQL that help us write more complex queries and more complicated logic. For example:

* Select all items that are in stock AND price below Â£19.99
* Select all books NOT published in 2017 
* Select all birthdays BETWEEN 2000 and 2005.

---

# `!=`

This means NOT EQUAL.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209316624-4a70f68d-1c60-45d2-aa25-91063f282f20.png)

In the above example, we are selecting `title` column from the books table where the year is NOT EQUAL to 2017.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209317093-70086989-ae44-4a6d-b877-3ca240db56a7.png)

Here, are are only selecting entries which were released in 2017.

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released_year = 2017;
```

---

But if we put a `!` before the `=` sign, it now means not equal to 2017. So we'll select any books where release year is anything but 2017...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209317452-9e020fc5-3394-4e4b-af87-8e99bed2d56c.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released_year != 2017;
```

---

Another exampe is where we don't want to output any books writted by the surname Gaiman. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209317956-8252ebc1-deb4-4e23-a51e-0318de51157c.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_lname !='Gaiman';
```

Now we see all the books except those written by Gaiman.

NOTE: `=` and `!=` are COMPARISON operators, not LOGICAL operators.

---

<!-- L 178 - NOT LIKE --> 

# `NOT LIKE`

This is the opposite of `LIKE`. For example if we wanted to find a title name where there is a space, we would use...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209319959-a453cc5c-b56f-4a4e-978e-fa94dc55d954.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '% %';
```
---

However, if we wanted to see the title names which do not have a space, we can use ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209320128-ba6d4094-833b-4807-85f0-db165b8d18da.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title NOT LIKE '% %';
```
We're now selecting all the books where there is no match to this pattern where the title is not like this pattern (`% %`).

--- 

Another example is that we have many author first names which start with `da`. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209320674-0e5bdf49-9dd1-4796-a4b9-3552caa99f9a.png)

```sql
SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname FROM books WHERE author_fname LIKE 'da%';
```

But if we do not want to see those entries where the author's first name starts with `da`, we can use ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209320964-b78a8cb2-ac9f-420c-ba3e-dbfe66f28247.png)

```sql
SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname FROM books WHERE author_fname NOT LIKE 'da%';
```
---

Another example is where we try to only output titles which do not contain the letter `e`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209321230-34421290-10f4-4398-b9fa-ade6da071663.png)

Here, it only outputs titles which have not got an `e` in the title.

```sql
SELECT title FROM books WHERE title NOT LIKE '%e%';
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209325724-6a547ca7-a3b0-47bd-bfe2-ca7f6108f46d.png)

---

<!-- L 180 - Greater Than --> 

# `>` - Greater Than

This is the next operator we are looking at.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209327586-6f61926c-b403-4b52-b4ca-e8c06115cf49.png)

If we wanted to output all books which were released aftter 2000, we can do the above. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209328603-27b6e3ed-3a2e-4d7e-b5e6-21cf92465020.png)


Here, we are searching for titles which were released after the year 1995.

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE released_year > 1995;
```

---

Another example is if we wanted to search for books which contained more than 500 pages ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209328810-3dd7d1d3-95be-40cb-bba9-3f03f4869431.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209329580-5de18ca9-6941-47b9-b124-23b47823db48.png)

What do you think will happen when we run this? 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209329775-6ab20088-d796-4ac8-be79-096f9cf2494f.png)

It evaluates to a number. If the statement is true, it will return a 1 and if the statement is false, it returns 0. Because in the above example 99 is greater than 1, it returns 1.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209329973-0e94747c-16ba-4616-9a36-50d694599e77.png)

Because in this example, 1 is not greater than 99, it returns 0.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209330688-794508f4-5889-4d1e-a31f-fdd8018d4c6f.png)

Here, the SQL evaluates `pages > 500` with each row. If the number of pages is not greater than 500, it returns a 0 and does not include that row in the results and if it gets 1, which means it is true, it includes that row in the results.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209331656-842cd4d4-c0e7-4d46-bd6a-b01772af6ead.png)

When we try to evaluate against `NULL`, we get `NULL` returned as NUll represents a lack of a value. So, how can we compare a number, like 1, to nothingness. 

So just know that you'll always get `NULL` when we try and make these comparisons with `NULL` and some other value.

---

# `<` - Less Than 

The opposite of `>`, greater than, is `<`, less than.

Let's select all the books released before the year 1995 ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209332624-e4955118-62e8-490f-8d3a-56cc76fb25cf.png)

```sql
SELECT title, released_year FROM books WHERE released_year < 1995;
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209333554-807f6d6c-827e-4bb8-aaa5-1308d701fbb0.png)

We can then sort those results 

```sql
SELECT title, released_year FROM books 
WHERE released_year < 1995
ORDER BY released_year DESC;
```

---

Another example is let's try and find the books which have less than 200 pages ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338011-d6224434-29a1-44ee-8c92-2e63cab7bf47.png)

```sql
SELECT book_id, title, pages FROM books 
WHERE pages < 200;
```

---

# Greater Than or Equal To `>=` and Less Than or Equal to `<=`

This is our table:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338234-75b38ba2-9c69-44aa-be51-c466907d71d6.png)

---

Let's say we want to find all the books released after 2010 but we also want to inlcude the year 2010 in the output results.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338441-5f180bb1-f092-4c8f-8da4-9e2d099617ce.png)

We can do the above, but it won't include any books released in the year 2010, instead, it starts checking from 2011.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338607-0462cb78-4a8b-4b73-a7e1-02974370006c.png)

So, we can do `>=` (greater than or equal to). So now this will include all rows where the value for release year is either 2010 exactly or anything greater than 2010.

---

Same is applied `<=` (less than or equal to). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338805-92b8e06e-7420-4bd3-ad2e-19cfdad9f7d5.png)

Here, `< 1985` starts checking from 1984 and below but does not include the year 1985.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209338895-ceef3af7-ae83-4079-bdd2-d5caef7cf24f.png)

Now, the year 1985 is included. 

---

<!-- L184 - Logical AND --> 

# Logical `AND`

So, 

* `<`
* `<=`
* `>`
* `>=`

are comparison operators. They are called this because they compare two values.

Now we will look at logical operators, Logical `AND`, Logical `OR` and Logical `NOT`.

---

Imagine we wanted to create a query from our books table which:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209799529-cca4fbcb-dafe-409a-b59c-1afa2db5d9f2.png)

here, we want to select all the books written by Dave Eggers that were published after the year 2010.

There is two pieces of information we are filtering by here, firstly, we are selecting author nameswhere the name is equal to Dave Eggers, and secondly, we are finding books that were released after 2010.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209802477-19ff9810-31de-4f61-bb6c-9b5868fc4161.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209802540-04b1ca34-21f3-47d2-be93-3581f3982834.png)

We know how to select both of these queries indivdually. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209802883-c0168ad6-843c-42c1-9516-e9dd02fa8f2b.png)

And 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209802952-8a01c447-61a3-4832-80a1-f4df90bead34.png)

---

But we now want to combine these two into one query. The way we can do this is by using `AND`. This joins two or more pieces of logic. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209803069-c091e286-6766-4d94-9453-d7a2b409f2df.png)


So in order for a book to be included in the results of this query, `author_lname=\'Eggers` has to come out to be true and `released_year > 2010` has to come out to be true. If only one of them is true, then that book doesn't count. It's not included in the results.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209803756-cf55789a-9eca-4641-ab61-41ada92ea740.png)

The query now only returns two results (books) where author last name is Eggers and which were released after 2010.

---

We can chain together (AND statements) as many as we like. Another example is:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE author_lname='Eggers' AND 
released_year > 2010 AND
title LIKE '%novel%';
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209806845-c6dd95db-cbc6-4749-b95b-484f69f2e3dd.png)

Here, we are looking for a book where the author's last name is Eggers, AND was released after 2010, AND the title contains the string `novel`.

---

Another example is where we are looking for books where the title has more than 30 charcters AND has more than `pages`. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209808952-d3b2d129-3098-466e-9182-7bfbae421580.png)

---
<!-- L 186 - Logical OR -->

# Logical OR

In Loigcal `OR`, left and right side of the `OR` are evaluated. Only one of them has to be true in order for the whole thing to be true.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209825556-7a01cf3f-17e4-427f-b6fc-0f14bc570562.png)

Here, `4 = 5` is false, but because `1 < 5` is true, the whole thing is true (true is represented by 1).

---

If we change:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209809412-cb0afbad-6c82-4e10-b377-170207d3da16.png)

the `AND` to a `OR` with everything else exactly the same, we will get a very different result...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209825199-0277d31a-bb1e-4d6d-9456-123c85cf58b6.png)

In the `OR` result (the second one in the above screenshot), it contains all of the books that have an author name of Eggers OR  all of the books that have a release year greater than 2010.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209825712-85d45e36-662a-4d43-8deb-9792c43dfa86.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209825735-1e0a114d-9dd1-43a0-81c7-9305967bcb59.png)

---

Another example of `OR` is if we wanted to search for books which have less than 200 pages or the word `stories` within the title:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209826035-a2c8103d-63f4-48c5-bb96-73522b9c7922.png)


This returns results which have either less than 200 pages OR titles which contian the word `stories`.

```sql
SELECT title, pages FROM books
WHERE pages < 200 
OR title LIKE '%stories%';
```

---

<!-- L 188 - Between -->

# Between

Between helps us to narrow down values that are between a certain range. For example: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209827449-fe00b0fa-ccd8-44c6-beb2-bc69d624b4cd.png)

To do the above using `AND`, we would have had to use something like: 

```sql
SELECT title, released_year FROM 
books WHERE released_year >= 2004 AND
released_year <= 2015;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209827614-d1c7cbec-f211-47db-9bfe-9a203657491e.png)

This would give us the books published between 2004 and 2015.

---

This means, we can still use `AND`, but `BETWEEN` mmakes things easier as it is shorter to write...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209828492-c3493831-653f-4b36-a395-4260606af7b3.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209828553-fc3a3547-320f-4fa6-8f56-aa261ce5a2a7.png)

```sql
SELECT title, released_year FROM books 
WHERE released_year BETWEEN 2004 AND 2015;
```

Here, we are not using `AND` two different comparisons. 

NOTE: `BETWEEN` is inclusive, that is why we are seeing results for 2004 too. 

---

Another example is selecting the books which have between 200-300 pages ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209831993-770438f7-d196-4ba7-b284-8e60baf6fee0.png)

---

# NOT BETWEEN

`NOT BETWEEN` is when we want to exclude a certain range

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209832130-f95623e9-5a5d-4532-8991-26b4dc16f309.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209832184-a66e6ad2-ac2a-4d06-b326-21cb4852f71c.png)

Here, we are excluding the books which hae been released between 2004 and 2015.

---

Another example is if we wanted to not display books which have pages between 200 and 300 ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209832445-53b69a4e-e684-4354-858a-59d747e7808f.png)

---

<!-- L 190 - Comparing Dates -->

# Comparing Dates

First of all, let's go over some things about dates.

(Go to lesson 157 till 168)

---

# DATE
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209836879-7a08a344-10f3-4a3f-b2e0-033051263caa.png)

# TIME
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209836938-5a961592-a475-434c-9310-703ce14ec613.png)

# DATETIME
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209836977-5b51e6a3-a02b-400b-a26a-533728599661.png)

---

Let's use all of them ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209836842-ad820166-b6a9-4fc4-8d89-09fed0204460.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209838038-b93d5ab1-1e91-4f6e-9fb8-69b6a50a9dc3.png)

Now we have added rows into the table so we can see how we can compare dates.

---

We can use comparison operators, such as `<`, `>`, `>=,`, with `DATE`, `TIME` and `DATETIME` too. For example, if we wanted to select entries which were born before 2005, we would do ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209847006-56091fd0-2fad-4844-bae3-d8a59c384987.png)

Remember, `'2005-01-01'` is a string.

---

# `YEAR`

Another way we can do it, is by extracting the year from the `birthdate` column. We can do this by using the `YEAR` function ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209847456-752bdaeb-aae6-4d15-b36e-9cd5611e549c.png)

---

# HOUR

We can also work with time. If we wanted to find all those who were born after 12pm, we can write:

```sql
SELECT * FROM staff 
WHERE HOUR(birthtime) > 12; 
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209938525-627b139d-ca66-4986-b620-416439f4b7c6.png)

The `HOUR` function extracts the hour and we can then use a number instead of a string to compare times. 

---

# CAST

`CAST` helps us to convert one data type to another. When working with `BETWEEN` and making comparisons, we can use `CAST` with them. For example, if we are looking for all the people born between 12pm and 6pm, we could do:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209939032-9ef7326b-12cf-446e-bbdc-5fef0f6ec7c7.png)

---

But if wanted to be more precise with the minutes and seconds, we could use `CAST`. For example: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209939356-444f0111-73ea-49b0-b80d-223838eae38e.png)

--- 

As mentioned above, if just wanted the hour portion, then use the HOUR function: 

```sql
SELECT * FROM staff 
WHERE HOUR(birthtime) BETWEEN 12 AND 18; 
```

---

<!-- L192 - The IN Operator --> 

# The IN Operator

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209939729-68e5c3e9-983a-44b6-aeb5-622cb86c3948.png)

If we wanted to only select the books written by Carver, Lahiri, or Smith, normally, we would use the `OR` operator. For example, we would write:

```sql
SELECT title, author_lname FROM books
WHERE author_lname='Carver' OR
      author_lname='Lahiri' OR
      author_lname='Smith';
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209939856-4002ed0e-8511-46eb-baae-5782b53099c7.png)

This gives us the books written by Carver, Lahiri, and Smith only.

However, the issue with this is that it is very long and can become even more time consuming if we had to write an expression with `OR` for each item on the list. 

---

So, there is a simpler and quicker way of getting the same result and that is by using the `IN` operator. 

```sql
SELECT title, author_lname FROM books
WHERE author_lname IN ('Carver', 'Lahiri', 'Smith');
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209940262-ee2afc0d-e96c-4edf-b475-7779b6d46c68.png)

We get the same result.

The `IN` operator helps us select values based off of whether some column is in some set of values. So we use parentheses to make a set of values. Anything in this list, like Carver, Lahiri and Smith, If `author_lname` is in that set, then the result is included.

---

# The NOT IN Operator 
 
The NOT IN Operator excludes the items in its list from the results. So, 

```sql
SELECT title, author_lname FROM books
WHERE author_lname NOT IN ('Carver', 'Lahiri', 'Smith');
```

will exclude Carver, Lahiri, and Smith from the results, for example: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/209940636-1b68cd85-8498-4afe-ae4c-7a153cb4c4e3.png)

Here, all the books which have NOT been written by Carver, Lahiri, and Smith will be outputted.

If we wanted to exclude all the books which were released in the above years, which are even years, we could use: 

```sql
SELECT title, released_year FROM books
WHERE released_year != 2000 AND
      released_year != 2002 AND
      released_year != 2004 AND
      released_year != 2006 AND
      released_year != 2008 AND
      released_year != 2010 AND
      released_year != 2012 AND
      released_year != 2014 AND
      released_year != 2016;
```

However, this is very long and time consuming.

So, instead, we can use: 

```sql
SELECT title, released_year FROM books
WHERE released_year NOT IN 
(2000,2002,2004,2006,2008,2010,2012,2014,2016);
```

Here, we get the same result whilst also beinga a lot more quicker and easier to write.

Let's say we also only want to output books released  after the year 2000. We could write:

# % - Modulo 

Modulo is also known as the remainder operator. To find out if a number is even or odd, if the result is 0, it means that number is even.

For example, `12 % 2` will equals 0. This means 12 is even. `13533 % 2` equals 1, which means it is odd.

---

```sql
SELECT title, released_year FROM books
WHERE released_year >= 2000 AND
released_year % 2 != 0;
```

So, we can use `modulo % 2` is not equal to 0, and it will exclude even years.

Here, even years have been excluded.

Here, only even years have been outputted.

Another way to only output odd years is to write `released_year % 2 = 1`. This means to only include odd years.
