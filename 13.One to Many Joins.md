# One to Many Joins

So far, we have covered data whcih is basically within one table at a time.the data has been kind of self contained and no data has been related.But of course, in the real world, all of our data or almost all of it, is related.

For example, we don't have books on a website without also having things like reviews, customers and shopping carts.

Or we might have cars in our database, but then we might have salesmen and dealerships and all of the other things that go along with it.

Now we will start to work with multiple tables that are connected.

So we're going to talk about how data is related and then how to implement those relations using multiple tables and some of the buzzwords, some of the big things 
we're talking about here are joints, foreign keys and primary keys, one to one, one to many, many to many relationships etc.
