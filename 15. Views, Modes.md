"Views are stored queries that, when invoked, produce a result set. A view acts as a virtual table."

---

At their core, `views` are some query that we give a name to and we can store, so we don't have to write that query over and over and over. And when we execute a view, we will see the result of our stored query, and it will feel like it's a table that we have stored. But it's not. It is a virtual table.

---

An example of where we might use this is our Many-to-Many Relational Database of `reviews` which we used in the last section. We may want to join all the tables together so we can see a lot more information. For example, we want to see ...

So, this may be a common starting point we would like to always use. So, instead of having to write this query out everytime, we can create a view. Views allow us to take a query like this that returns some results and we'll be able to store it and give it a name, and then we'll be able to treat it as if it were a true table. This isn't a real table in our database. This is the result of a query that joins together three tables,

# Syntax for Creating a View

```yaml
CREATE VIEW <name_of_view> AS <query_we_want_to_store> 
```

So, using the above example, we can create a view for that query ...

```sql
CREATE VIEW start_point AS SELECT title, released_year, genre, rating, first_name, last_name FROM reviews
JOIN series ON series.id = reviews.series_id
JOIN reviewers ON reviews.reviewer_id = reviewers.id;
```

Then, when we run this, nothing happens to our tables ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/214555358-e13bba4a-026e-439b-bbaf-5d92ad3ff108.png)

but we have a virtual table. If we run `show tables`, we will see it in our list of tables, but we never created a table called start_point ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/214555749-089a918b-78c8-4842-a785-09f4048c69b2.png)

`start_point` is just a virtual table, a view that we've set up using the `CREATE VIEW` query.

Now we can return this table using `SELECT * FROM start_point;` and we get all of that information we got from the long query ...

```sql
SELECT title, released_year, genre, rating, first_name, last_name FROM reviews
JOIN series ON series.id = reviews.series_id
JOIN reviewers ON reviews.reviewer_id = reviewers.id;
```

---

We can the n use other functions with this virtual table. For example `WHERE` clause ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/214557713-82e413ca-e20b-4bef-a02a-72350aad53e6.png)

This means we can treat it as if it were a table.

It doesn't allow us to do anything new that we couldn't do before, but it allows us to write much shorter queries  instead of having a large query at the beginning of every one of our queries.

---

We can then also use a `GROUP BY` with a virtual table. And now we see the average rating for each one of those genres.

Once we have created a virtual table, we can treat it a a normal table.

<!-- 262. Updateable Views -->

# Updateable Views

There are some things we can't do with views because they are not true tables. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/214560363-2b2f1b0a-afb6-4f2f-b0e6-f32243f05409.png)

For example, if we wanted to delete all rows which have 2000 as their `released_year` ....

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/214560623-5cb59e98-c5fa-4154-a2ab-ccd34a1a4bd0.png)

we can't. It says cannot delete from join view called tv_db.start_point. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/214560901-d4174142-45f6-41e1-bad3-f91452a6dba6.png)

Only a very small portion of views are updatable and insertable,  in other words,we can insert into them, and update them, and treat them as if they were a table. Same thing with delete.

If you have any of the highlighted things in the above screenshot from the docs in your view, it will be difficult to make changes. For example, if we use an Aggregate function in our view, that means that view is no longer updatable, deleteable or insertable.

The point is that our view is not updatable. It's not going to work for us. But that doesn't mean all views are limited to only SELECT queries.

---

There are some views are updatable and in searchable. For example:

let's say this is something which we use very often. Let's create a view of it ...

Now we can see our virtual table.
