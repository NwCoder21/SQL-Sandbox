"Views are stored queries that, when invoked, produce a result set. A view acts as a virtual table."

---

At their core, `views` are some query that we give a name to and we can store, so we don't have to write that query over and over and over. And when we execute a view, we will see the result of our stored query, and it will feel like it's a table that we have stored. But it's not. It is a virtual table.

---

An example of where we might use this is our Many-to-Many Relational Database of `reviews` which we used in the last section. We may want to join all the tables together so we can see a lot more information. For example, we want to see ...

So, this may be a common starting point we would like to always use. So, instead of having to write this query out everytime, we can create a view. Views allow us to take a query like this that returns some results and we'll be able to store it and give it a name, and then we'll be able to treat it as if it were a true table. This isn't a real table in our database. This is the result of a query that joins together three tables,

# Syntax for Creating a View

```yaml
CREATE VIEW <name_of_view> AS <query_we_want_to_store> 
```

So, using the above example, we can create a view for that query ...

```sql
CREATE VIEW start_point AS SELECT title, released_year, genre, rating, first_name, last_name FROM reviews
JOIN series ON series.id = reviews.series_id
JOIN reviewers ON reviews.reviewer_id = reviewers.id;
```

Then, when we run this, nothing happens to our tables ...

but we have a virtual table. If we run `show tables`, we will see it in our list of tables, but we never created a table called start_point ...

`start_point` is just a virtual table, a view that we've set up using the `CREATE VIEW` query.

Now we can return this table using `SELECT * FROM start_point;` and we get all of that information we got from the long query ...

```sql
SELECT title, released_year, genre, rating, first_name, last_name FROM reviews
JOIN series ON series.id = reviews.series_id
JOIN reviewers ON reviews.reviewer_id = reviewers.id;
```

---

We can the n use other functions with this virtual table. For example `WHERE` clause ...

This means we can treat it as if it were a table.

It doesn't allow us to do anything new that we couldn't do before, but it allows us to write much shorter queries  instead of having a large query at the beginning of every one of our queries.

We can then also use a `GROUP BY` with a virtual table. And now we see the average rating for each one of those genres.

Once we have created a virtual table, we can treat it a a normal table.
