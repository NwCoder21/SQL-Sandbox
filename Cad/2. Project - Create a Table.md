# Code

```sql
-- Step 1 - Create a table named friends with three columns:
--     id that stores INTEGER
--     name that stores TEXT
--     birthday that stores DATE

CREATE TABLE friends (
id INTEGER,
name TEXT,
birthday DATE
);

-- Step 2: Beneath your current code, add Ororo Munroe to friends.
-- Her birthday is May 30th, 1940. For the `DATE` data type, the format is YYYY-MM-DD

INSERT INTO friends (id,name,birthday) 
VALUES(1,'Ororo Munroe', '1940-05-30');

-- Step3: Let’s make sure that Ororo has been added to the database:
-- Check for two things: Is friends table created and Is Ororo Munroe added to it?

-- SELECT * FROM friends;

-- Step 4: Add two of your friends to the table. Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them.

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (2, 'Joe Bloggs', '1976-02-24');
 
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (3, 'Guy Chesire', '1998-10-03');

-- Step 5: Ororo Munroe just realized that she can control the weather and decided to change her name. Her new name is “Storm”. Update her record in friends.

UPDATE friends
SET name='Storm'
WHERE id=1;

-- Step 6: Add a new column named email. The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table: 
 -- ALTER TABLE table_name -- ADD COLUMN column DATA_TYPE;

ALTER TABLE friends 
ADD COLUMN email TEXT;

-- Step 7:Update the email address for everyone in your table. Storm’s email is storm@codecademy.com.

UPDATE friends
SET email ='storm@codecademy.com' WHERE id =1;

UPDATE friends
SET email ='joe@codecademy.com'
WHERE id =2;

UPDATE friends
SET email ='guy@codecademy.com'
WHERE id =3;

-- Step 8: Wait, Storm is fictional, remove her from friends.
DELETE FROM friends
WHERE id =1;

-- Step 9: Let’s take a look at the result one last time:
SELECT * FROM friends;

```

This is the end result database.
