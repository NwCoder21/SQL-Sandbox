```sql
-- Step 1 - Create a table named friends with three columns:
--     id that stores INTEGER
--     name that stores TEXT
--     birthday that stores DATE

CREATE TABLE friends (
id INTEGER,
name TEXT,
birthday DATE
);

-- Step 2: Beneath your current code, add Ororo Munroe to friends.
-- Her birthday is May 30th, 1940. For the `DATE` data type, the format is YYYY-MM-DD

INSERT INTO friends (id,name,birthday) 
VALUES(1,'Ororo Munroe', '1940-05-30');

-- Step3: Let’s make sure that Ororo has been added to the database:
-- Check for two things: Is friends table created and Is Ororo Munroe added to it?

SELECT * FROM friends;

--Step 4: Add two of your friends to the table. Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them.

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (2, 'Joe Bloggs', '1976-02-24');
 
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (3, 'Guy Chesire', '1998-10-03');

--Step 5: Ororo Munroe just realized that she can control the weather and decided to change her name. Her new name is “Storm”. Update her record in friends.

UPDATE friends
SET name='Storm'
WHERE id=1;

-- Checking if table has been updated
SELECT * FROM friends;
