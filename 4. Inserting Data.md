# Inserting data

To insert data into a table, we use the `INSERT` statement. 

```sql
INSERT INTO <table_name> (name_ofcolumn1, name_ofcolumn2)
VALUES (value1, value2);
```

* We use the `INSERT INTO` keywords followed by the name of the table you want to insert the data into. 
* This is then followed by the name of the columns you want to insert data into.
* This is then followed by the `VALUES` keyword
* Then comes a pair of brackets which contains the values you want to add to the columns. They needto corrspond to the correct column (in order).

These are the different ways this can be written.

In the aboce example, I have inserted an Appleand its price is 5, into the fruits table.

# Quick Preview of SELECT

So, how do we check if the above statement of INSERT worked? We can use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM fruits;
```
`*` means all.

> Note: SELECT will be covered in more detail in the next section.

Here, we can see both enstries to the fruits table, Apple and Kiwi with their price.

# Multi Inserts

When inserting values, the order of the coulmns does not matter. However, whatever order you do choose, the values need to correspond to that. For example, in the fruits table, we can call the price column first and then the name column:

Let's say we use to wring order:

Here, I have entered `Lemon` first even though when writing the columns, I wrote `price` first. When this happens, an error will occur. This errorwill prevent the line from being inserted into the table.

We can insert multiple rows at once, which is a common operation. we don't have to have,for example, three seperate INSERT statements to insert three rows. SO, I can do one INSERT INTO fruits, and then enter multiple values eperated by commas.

Here, have added three more fruits to the fruits table using one INSERT statement.

```sql
INSERT INTO fruits (name, price)
VALUES ("Banana", 4),
("Melon", 8),
("Grapes", 7);
```

And we can check that it has worked by using:

```sql
SELECT * FROM fruits;
```
