# Inserting data

To insert data into a table, we use the `INSERT` statement. 

```sql
INSERT INTO <table_name> (name_ofcolumn1, name_ofcolumn2)
VALUES (value1, value2);
```

* We use the `INSERT INTO` keywords followed by the name of the table you want to insert the data into. 
* This is then followed by the name of the columns you want to insert data into.
* This is then followed by the `VALUES` keyword
* Then comes a pair of brackets which contains the values you want to add to the columns. They needto corrspond to the correct column (in order).

These are the different ways this can be written.

In the aboce example, I have inserted an Appleand its price is 5, into the fruits table.

<!-- Lesson 36 - Quick Preview of SELECT -->

# Quick Preview of SELECT

So, how do we check if the above statement of INSERT worked? We can use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM fruits;
```
`*` means all.

> Note: SELECT will be covered in more detail in the next section. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/205935376-bce4f105-777f-4559-a985-c01fd9ef20bc.png)


Here, we can see both enstries to the fruits table, Apple and Kiwi with their price.

<!-- Lesson 38 - Multi Inserts -->

# Multi Inserts

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/205937714-3c4c1f37-37f2-4b51-aab0-70eaf03cddee.png)

When inserting values, the order of the coulmns does not matter. However, whatever order you do choose, the values need to correspond to that. For example, in the fruits table, we can call the price column first and then the name column:

---

Let's say we use to wring order: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/205938198-193de7af-ca1c-4f75-a546-2209786af1f2.png)

Here, I have entered `Lemon` first even though when writing the columns, I wrote `price` first. When this happens, an error will occur. This errorwill prevent the line from being inserted into the table.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/205939473-31f03b97-caac-4590-b4fe-4b9df2af1311.png)

We can insert multiple rows at once, which is a common operation. we don't have to have,for example, three seperate INSERT statements to insert three rows. SO, I can do one INSERT INTO fruits, and then enter multiple values eperated by commas. 

---

Here, have added three more fruits to the fruits table using one INSERT statement.

```sql
INSERT INTO fruits (name, price)
VALUES ("Banana", 4),
("Melon", 8),
("Grapes", 7);
```

And we can check that it has worked by using:

```sql
SELECT * FROM fruits;
```

And finally, have dropped the `people` table.

<!-- Lesson 41 - Working with NOT NULL --> 

#  Working with `NOT NULL`

Here, we are looking at the Null column. It means, if Null is set to yes, the name and/or the age field for a record can be empty. 
It means the value is not known, rather it is unknown. 
Null is different to zero. Zero is a value. Null means there is no information/value  at all.

---

For example, if we added an entry to a table, in this case, the pastries table, and did not provide a value for one of the columns, in this case, the quantity column, an error will not occur, instead, Null will be displayed in that column. <br>

It means there is no value at all for age on this row.

 # `NOT NULL` - Adding a Constraint 
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206205015-f9514940-e9d1-408c-933d-5e1ac32103e1.png)


To ensure that a column can not contain `NOT NULL`, all we do is add on `NOT NULL` when we are creating a table. For each column, we specify the name of the column like age, the type, int, and then `NOT NULL`, just like we could do Primary key.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206205979-34f0f234-5140-4dd7-948d-448c932f97b1.png)

So, if we now try to insert data into a table, without specifying a value and an error will occur.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206206693-d44a8e2a-b665-44a4-b50c-2b9bcd1d3c57.png)

We can see from the above statement, that it does not work at all and nothing is entered into the table.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206207564-6b0d3351-8504-4495-8640-eadc65a62f14.png)

Now if we describe this new table, fruits2, we will see that both columns, `name` and `price`, do not allow for NULL.

### Using `NOTÂ NULL`:

```sql
    CREATE TABLE cats2 (
        name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        age INT NOT NULL
    );
```

<!-- Lesson 44 - Quotes in MySQL  --> 

#  Quotes in MySQL

When working with text in MySQL, we can use double or single quotes, however, best practise to use single quotes, as in other relational database management systems, in other words, other flavors of SQL, it may cause errors when using double quotes. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206209516-ff5028b3-d590-4aba-9ef5-5ae059b2a074.png)

The above will work.

# Escaping Quotes - `\`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206209922-16307efc-4792-4468-82bf-9cef5dec8c24.png)

The issue here is that the program thinks the first two `'` are opening and closing quotes. It thinks the 3rd quote needs a closing quote, hence it will throw an error. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206211105-6767610f-8f8c-40d6-9674-569ca4609a92.png)

The solution to this is to escape the apostrophe using a `\`. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206211411-b373b49b-91a4-4668-b5df-b050a8d4f183.png)

we can now see that it works.

---

We can do the same for double quotes:

* If we use double quotes on the outside, we can still use double quotes on the inside by also using the escape character, such as:

```sql
INSERT INTO stores(name)
VALUES("The man said \"my nameis Joe.""");
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206213335-d6218cdd-c230-4773-904d-6aa14ce6d55b.png)

---

* If we are using single quotes on the outside, we can use double quotes within the single quotes without the need for escaping the double quotes.
* However, as it is best practise to use single quotes on the outside, we can use double quotes

<!-- Lesson 45 - Adding DEFAULT Values --> 

# Adding DEFAULT Values

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206214023-d9757eb7-fbb9-4017-bead-77ff13949068.png)

When we describe a table, we have this default column here that describes the default values present for a column. At the moment, this means, that there is no default value for this column.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206214425-f3c4ab7e-3e4a-440b-a09c-7081913f33a9.png)

When we create a table, we can specify a default value using this syntax `DEFAULT` and then immediately after, seperated by a space, whatever the default value is, in between a pair of single quotes.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206224705-1be780dd-c0bf-4b31-ad10-a6633d711f7e.png)

Here, we can see that even though we hae not entered a value for `price`, it shows up as three when running the `SELECT` command as we have already set that up to be 3 by default if no value is provided.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206225207-8f29e504-65e2-4fe6-b2c7-a98a78c0a634.png)


This is example of not providing any values when running the `INSERT INTO` statement. We can see that noo error occurs, rather, it fills the fields up with their respetive `DEFAULT` values. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/206225816-9cff1955-b315-4da5-aa5f-9df886d810b4.png)

Using `DESC`, we can see what the default values are for each column.
