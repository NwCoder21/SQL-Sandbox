# 12.Constraints & ALTER TABLE

<!-- L 200 - UNIQUE --> 

In this section, we're going to learn about more constraints that we can use when setting up a table.

An example of a constraint we have already covered is `NOT NULL`. If we use `NOT NULL` on a column, it can't be `NULL`. That is a constraint.

Another example is `PRIMARY KEY`

# `UNIQUE`

This is the next constraint we are going to over.

```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
    supplier_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (supplier_id)
);
```
`UNIQUE` allows us to set up particular column to be unique. In the above example: 

```sql
phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
```

`phone` has to be unique.

For example, if we create the above table and add an entry into it.

If we add another entry, and we try to enter the same exact data for the `UNIQUE` column, in this case the `phone` column an error will occur.

If we try to run the `SELECT` query, it will not show the duplicate entry.

If we use the same name, and chnage the phone number slighty for the second entry, it will now work as we have not set the name column to be unique.

---

We can use `UNIQUE` for any column. If a column is `PRIMARY KEY`, that column has to be unique anyway, so no need to write `UNIQUE` for a `PRIMARY KEY` column. In the same way `NOT NULL` can be used with `PRIMARY KEY` as `PRIMARY KEY` columns are required.

<!-- L 202 - CHECK Constraints --> 

# CHECK Constraints

The `CHECK` constraints allow us to define custom constraints on a given column or columns.

In the example above, `age INT CHECK (age > 18)` will make sure that a number greater than 18 is entered for the `age` column.
