# 12.Constraints & ALTER TABLE

<!-- L 200 - UNIQUE --> 

In this section, we're going to learn about more constraints that we can use when setting up a table.

An example of a constraint we have already covered is `NOT NULL`. If we use `NOT NULL` on a column, it can't be `NULL`. That is a constraint.

Another example is `PRIMARY KEY`

# `UNIQUE`

This is the next constraint we are going to over. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210089710-f84c0556-ca73-4d24-88be-73cc18f1905f.png)

```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
    supplier_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (supplier_id)
);
```
`UNIQUE` allows us to set up particular column to be unique. In the above example: 

```sql
phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
```

`phone` has to be unique.

For example, if we create the above table and add an entry into it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

INSERT INTO contacts (name, phone)
VALUES('Dylan Ellis','123456789');

INSERT INTO contacts (name, phone)
VALUES('Dylan Ellis','0123456789');
```

If we add another entry, and we try to enter the same exact data for the `UNIQUE` column, in this case the `phone` column an error will occur. 

---

If we try to run the `SELECT` query, it will not show the duplicate entry.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210090842-7f15d668-855e-4217-8f3e-4d87a6d5fe8f.png)

If we use the same name, and chnage the phone number slighty for the second entry, it will now work as we have not set the name column to be unique.

---

We can use `UNIQUE` for any column. If a column is `PRIMARY KEY`, that column has to be unique anyway, so no need to write `UNIQUE` for a `PRIMARY KEY` column. In the same way `NOT NULL` can be used with `PRIMARY KEY` as `PRIMARY KEY` columns are required.

<!-- L 202 - CHECK Constraints --> 

# CHECK Constraints

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210091356-fa720670-df8a-4900-999e-dbf98d3d81eb.png)

The `CHECK` constraints allow us to define custom constraints on a given column or columns.

In the example above, `age INT CHECK (age > 18)` will make sure that a number greater than 18 is entered for the `age` column. `age > 18` will return either 1, for true, or 0, for false. If it is true, age will be considered valid. 

---

For example if we create a `users` table. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
	name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT CHECK (age > 0) 
);

INSERT INTO users (name,age)
VALUES ('Johhny Jones', 23);

INSERT INTO users (name,age)
VALUES ('Marcus james', -25);
```

---

Then let's try to add some users ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210093327-4e3f5cf7-1b7c-48d5-96d3-6c73e8933108.png)

Here, there is no issue as age is greatee than 0. However, now let's try to add a user with the age of -25 ... 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210093666-c583889d-2702-442c-a0e3-4bf355102fdc.png)


Now, there is an error as the age has not passed the `CHECK` constraint.

---

If we then run `SELECT * FROM users;`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210093769-41d0f2f2-fe00-4d75-9443-9a8c08729231.png)

We will see that the latest entry has not been added to the table. 

---

We can use CHECK with strings and use all the other logical and comparison operators. As long as it can output a true or false expresson.  

Another example is:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210094229-f5c671de-6603-4b19-9aa8-1a6d82039584.png)

Here, the user needs to add a word into the table which spells out the same word even if it was to be reversed.

Next we are going to learn how to customise the name of our constraints when an error occurs. 


---

<!-- L 204 - Named Constraints -->

# Named Constraints

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210592080-1a5da813-84d1-48f3-8d52-a3633a38b8e8.png)

In order to create a custom name for a constraint, we use the keyword `Constraint` followed by a name, in this case, it is `age_over_18`, then the `CHECK` keyword followed by the expression we will be using to carry out the check.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210594183-6b5671e0-4433-4972-ba67-efc1f98183f7.png)

Here, we can see that when we try to run 

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name,age)
VALUES ('Marcus james', -45);
```

the error code states the constraint name is the same as the one we set.

This helps to debug and see what exactly went wrong.

For the palindromes table, to check the string being inputted was a palindrome, we would do something like this. 

---

 If you want to remove these constraints, we will discuss this once we talk about `ALTER TABLE`.

<!-- L 206 - Multiple Column Constraints -->

# Multiple Column Constraints

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210982658-0a5406aa-01ac-4eb6-b6b9-2a2191d5bd18.png)

 We can also set up our own constraints that use multiple columns.

So, in this example here, `CONSTRAINT name_address UNIQUE (name , address)`  it has a constraint that makes sure that the name and address combination are unique. So in this companies table, the name itself doesn't have to be unique because companies could have the same name, and the address doesn't have to be unique because there may be multiple companies housed in the same building, the same office, for example, or run from the same home.

But the combination of the two is what needs to be unique name and address.

---
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210987549-f710705c-3c0a-4d96-9e99-ae52918161c9.png)

For example, let's just create the above table with two column, `name` and `address`, neither of which can be null. But they don't have to be unique on their own.  They have to be unique as a combination.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210989435-881d140f-2347-404f-8e4d-1ee96ac454da.png)

Let's then add an entry. `Highfield Garage` which is located at `123 West Rd`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210989855-fe2d7901-b5b1-4f9f-ac6e-a8a72bdf72d0.png)

Then let's another entry, `Highfield Bakery` which is also located at `123 West Rd`.

This wont cause an error as even though both entries have the same location, they do not have the same name.

---

Now let's try to duplicate one of the entries...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210990957-e6dff342-48e8-43fb-be84-2ad7d08ad241.png)

Now the lastest entry we have tried to enter has the same name AND address as the second entry, an error occurs and the third entry is not ableto be addedd to the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT name_address UNIQUE (name , address)
);

INSERT INTO companies(name,address)
VALUES ('Highfield Garage','123 West Rd');

INSERT INTO companies(name,address)
VALUES ('Highfield Bakery','123 West Rd');

INSERT INTO companies(name,address)
VALUES ('Highfield Bakery','123 West Rd');
```

```diff
- REMEMEBER: the above example is using `UNIQUE`, not a CHECK constraint.
```

---

We can also use our own custom `CHECK` constraints that use multiple columns. For example, let's say we sell houses and we keep track of the price we bought a house for.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210995238-d11e6212-d610-45b5-9ce9-a5c79b94286e.png)

And I can add my own constraint that says the sale price has to be greater than the purchase price. In

```sql
CONSTRAINT sprice_greaterthan_pprice CHECK (sale_price >= purchase_price)
```

We're checking to see that `sale_price` is greater than or equal to `purchase_price`.

---

Let's now enter some values into the houses table...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210997183-1a72afea-2a38-4834-a733-93b49b664bce.png)

The first entry works as we bought the house for 100 and sold for 200. This passess the `CHECK` constraint as the `sale_price` is greater than the `purchase_price`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210997982-d2cc6d63-159f-4f10-862e-9bbb93ecf843.png)

However, when we try to add another entry, where the `sale_price` is less than the `purchase_price`, an error occurs.

```diff
- REMEMEBER: this was another example of a CHECK constraint which used two columns. However, you're not limited to simple comparisons like greater than, although that is what is probably most common, comparing equality greater than less than. But as we saw, you can do things like use string functions (such as what we used in the palindrome table, and date functions and time functions and all of that.
```
