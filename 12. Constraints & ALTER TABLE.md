# 12.Constraints & ALTER TABLE

<!-- L 200 - UNIQUE --> 

In this section, we're going to learn about more constraints that we can use when setting up a table.

An example of a constraint we have already covered is `NOT NULL`. If we use `NOT NULL` on a column, it can't be `NULL`. That is a constraint.

---

Another example is `PRIMARY KEY`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210089614-5c7d3c5a-4e5d-498b-a783-07603e51fb8a.png)

---

# `UNIQUE`

This is the next constraint we are going to over. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210089710-f84c0556-ca73-4d24-88be-73cc18f1905f.png)

```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
    supplier_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (supplier_id)
);
```
`UNIQUE` allows us to set up particular column to be unique. In the above example: 

```sql
phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
```

`phone` has to be unique. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210090322-9f510900-0197-4df6-8fe0-d5617f13ad0c.png)

For example, if we create the above table and add an entry into it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

INSERT INTO contacts (name, phone)
VALUES('Dylan Ellis','123456789');

INSERT INTO contacts (name, phone)
VALUES('Dylan Ellis','0123456789');
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210090539-0c2620b7-1f27-48b9-9e5a-56a4b27442bd.png)

If we add another entry, and we try to enter the same exact data for the `UNIQUE` column, in this case the `phone` column an error will occur. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210090712-cd623bdb-938e-4ba6-a5f1-8ac44e38f76c.png)

If we try to run the `SELECT` query, it will not show the duplicate entry.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210090842-7f15d668-855e-4217-8f3e-4d87a6d5fe8f.png)

If we use the same name, and chnage the phone number slighty for the second entry, it will now work as we have not set the name column to be unique.

---

We can use `UNIQUE` for any column. If a column is `PRIMARY KEY`, that column has to be unique anyway, so no need to write `UNIQUE` for a `PRIMARY KEY` column. In the same way `NOT NULL` can be used with `PRIMARY KEY` as `PRIMARY KEY` columns are required. 

---

<!-- L 202 - CHECK Constraints --> 

# CHECK Constraints

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210091356-fa720670-df8a-4900-999e-dbf98d3d81eb.png)

The `CHECK` constraints allow us to define custom constraints on a given column or columns.

In the example above, `age INT CHECK (age > 18)` will make sure that a number greater than 18 is entered for the `age` column. `age > 18` will return either 1, for true, or 0, for false. If it is true, age will be considered valid. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210093220-0c51c2fb-e722-48cc-b296-7552acdbc17f.png)

For example if we create a `users` table. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
	name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT CHECK (age > 0) 
);

INSERT INTO users (name,age)
VALUES ('Johhny Jones', 23);

INSERT INTO users (name,age)
VALUES ('Marcus james', -25);
```

---

Then let's try to add some users ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210093327-4e3f5cf7-1b7c-48d5-96d3-6c73e8933108.png)

Here, there is no issue as age is greatee than 0. However, now let's try to add a user with the age of -25 ... 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210093666-c583889d-2702-442c-a0e3-4bf355102fdc.png)


Now, there is an error as the age has not passed the `CHECK` constraint.

---

If we then run `SELECT * FROM users;`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210093769-41d0f2f2-fe00-4d75-9443-9a8c08729231.png)

We will see that the latest entry has not been added to the table. 

---

We can use CHECK with strings and use all the other logical and comparison operators. As long as it can output a true or false expresson.  

Another example is:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210094229-f5c671de-6603-4b19-9aa8-1a6d82039584.png)

Here, the user needs to add a word into the table which spells out the same word even if it was to be reversed.

Next we are going to learn how to customise the name of our constraints when an error occurs. 


---

<!-- L 204 - Named Constraints -->

# Named Constraints

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210592080-1a5da813-84d1-48f3-8d52-a3633a38b8e8.png)

In order to create a custom name for a constraint, we use the keyword `Constraint` followed by a name, in this case, it is `age_over_18`, then the `CHECK` keyword followed by the expression we will be using to carry out the check.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210594183-6b5671e0-4433-4972-ba67-efc1f98183f7.png)

Here, we can see that when we try to run 

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name,age)
VALUES ('Marcus james', -45);
```

the error code states the constraint name is the same as the one we set.

This helps to debug and see what exactly went wrong. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210594492-62c937f7-9038-43a8-8c7c-dd12919c1dbe.png)

For the palindromes table, to check the string being inputted was a palindrome, we would do something like this. 

---

 If you want to remove these constraints, we will discuss this once we talk about `ALTER TABLE`.

---


<!-- L 206 - Multiple Column Constraints -->

# Multiple Column Constraints

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210982658-0a5406aa-01ac-4eb6-b6b9-2a2191d5bd18.png)

 We can also set up our own constraints that use multiple columns.

So, in this example here, `CONSTRAINT name_address UNIQUE (name , address)`  it has a constraint that makes sure that the name and address combination are unique. So in this companies table, the name itself doesn't have to be unique because companies could have the same name, and the address doesn't have to be unique because there may be multiple companies housed in the same building, the same office, for example, or run from the same home.

But the combination of the two is what needs to be unique name and address.

---
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210987549-f710705c-3c0a-4d96-9e99-ae52918161c9.png)

For example, let's just create the above table with two column, `name` and `address`, neither of which can be null. But they don't have to be unique on their own.  They have to be unique as a combination.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210989435-881d140f-2347-404f-8e4d-1ee96ac454da.png)

Let's then add an entry. `Highfield Garage` which is located at `123 West Rd`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210989855-fe2d7901-b5b1-4f9f-ac6e-a8a72bdf72d0.png)

Then let's another entry, `Highfield Bakery` which is also located at `123 West Rd`.

This wont cause an error as even though both entries have the same location, they do not have the same name.

---

Now let's try to duplicate one of the entries...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210990957-e6dff342-48e8-43fb-be84-2ad7d08ad241.png)

Now the lastest entry we have tried to enter has the same name AND address as the second entry, an error occurs and the third entry is not ableto be addedd to the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT name_address UNIQUE (name , address)
);

INSERT INTO companies(name,address)
VALUES ('Highfield Garage','123 West Rd');

INSERT INTO companies(name,address)
VALUES ('Highfield Bakery','123 West Rd');

INSERT INTO companies(name,address)
VALUES ('Highfield Bakery','123 West Rd');
```

```diff
- REMEMEBER: the above example is using `UNIQUE`, not a CHECK constraint.
```

---

We can also use our own custom `CHECK` constraints that use multiple columns. For example, let's say we sell houses and we keep track of the price we bought a house for.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210995238-d11e6212-d610-45b5-9ce9-a5c79b94286e.png)

And I can add my own constraint that says the sale price has to be greater than the purchase price. In

```sql
CONSTRAINT sprice_greaterthan_pprice CHECK (sale_price >= purchase_price)
```

We're checking to see that `sale_price` is greater than or equal to `purchase_price`.

---

Let's now enter some values into the houses table...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210997183-1a72afea-2a38-4834-a733-93b49b664bce.png)

The first entry works as we bought the house for 100 and sold for 200. This passess the `CHECK` constraint as the `sale_price` is greater than the `purchase_price`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210997982-d2cc6d63-159f-4f10-862e-9bbb93ecf843.png)

However, when we try to add another entry, where the `sale_price` is less than the `purchase_price`, an error occurs.

```diff
- REMEMEBER: this was another example of a CHECK constraint which used two columns. However, you're not limited to simple comparisons like greater than, although that is what is probably most common, comparing equality greater than less than. But as we saw, you can do things like use string functions (such as what we used in the palindrome table, and date functions and time functions and all of that.
```

<!-- L208 - ALTER TABLE: Adding Columns --> 

# ALTER TABLE: Adding Columns

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/210999817-fd7d79c6-a833-4430-8f91-79ee2b79a2a9.png)

The `ALTER TABLE` statement helps us change tables. There are a lot of ways to change a table. For example: 

* We can add columns to a table.
* We can remove columns from a table. 
* We can rename columns. 
* We can change the data type of a column.
* We can add constraints, remove constraints.

---

# Adding New Column to Existing Table

To add a new column to an existing table, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211000712-523c4abb-6a9a-4a8e-9e2f-381ece934803.png)

```sql
ALTER TABLE companies 
ADD COLUMN city VARCHAR(25);
```
We use `ALTER TABLE` followed by the name of the table we are trying to alter. Then `ADD COLUMN` followed by the column_name and column_data_type, and if want to, other constraints.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211001162-90409754-6e33-40c4-847f-7668b588d764.png)

Here, we already have a companies table. What if we wanted to add another column such as `phone_number`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211001524-08d694a0-0e5b-4d69-ba15-115237e3fabf.png)

We can see that we have now added the `phone_number` column and for the rows which were already in the table, they have been given `NULL`.

---

If we don't want existing rows to be given a `NULL`, when we add a column, we can say that this column can not be `NULL`. So, for strings, it will be an empty string and for a numbers column, it will be a 0. For example: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211002425-18b17857-aa3e-440c-a7f6-760ce2582b51.png)

When we run:

```sql
ALTER TABLE companies
ADD COLUMN employee_count INT NOT NULL;
```

it gives existing rows a 0 for the `employee_count` column.

---

To enter a default value, we would use `DEFAULT`, for example: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211002801-b7718565-92ae-41e9-acaf-26890a889261.png)

Now, existing rows in the companies table are given a 1 for the `worker_count` column.

---

# ALTER TABLE: Dropping Columns

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211003301-8a03c5ee-f916-498d-bc45-fca7675ab8a6.png)

This is how we would drop columns from a table.

---

For example, we have the companies table which has a `employee_count` column:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211003649-d3d8dce0-a0f4-4777-b4e4-dc7ce5428cd6.png)

Using 

```sql
ALTER TABLE companies
DROP COLUMN employee_count;
```

the `employee_count` column has now been deleted.

---

# ALTER TABLE: Renaming

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211023690-f6067441-e9c3-42c3-883c-e977dfbd0d82.png)

We can re-name a table and we can also re-name a column. 

---

To re-name a table, we can use:

```yaml
RENAME TABLE <old_table_name> TO <new_table_name>
```
Or we can use:

```yaml
ALTER TABLE <old_table_name> RENAME TO <new_table_name>
```

---

For example we have this `companies` table:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211024321-8b85098b-4666-4115-86f5-22e01d8300e2.png)

---

Using 

```sql
RENAME TABLE companies TO suppliers;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211024528-9884f252-d3cc-4385-8994-d595b4a8f84d.png)

We have chnaged its name to suppliers.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211024625-05be29e4-f90d-4272-a426-759d886769bc.png)

Now when we run: 

```sql
SELECT * FROM companies;
```

an error occurs as need to use the new name of the table.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211024841-90aff20a-6964-44a9-bf86-3a5e38ec8e45.png)

Now we can query from the table using the new name `suppliers`.

---

The second method of renaming the table is :

```sql
ALTER TABLE suppliers RENAME TO companies;
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211029433-5abf1c18-bceb-4a9d-a6c5-54adc69e230b.png)

We now have changed the table `suppliers` to `companies`.

---

# Renaming Columns

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211029697-db41ab0c-64b8-458f-9985-0a7e774fda92.png)

This is how we would re-name a column.

We use 

```yaml
ALTER TABLE <table_name> RENAME COLUMN <current_column_name> TO <new_column_name>
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211030069-b0a5125d-b68f-42d3-a27b-1847573b074c.png)

For example, if we wanted to re-name the `phone_number` column to `contact`, we would 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211031984-2be52081-41e4-4b23-b706-4a21651038ee.png)

here, the column has now been re-named. 

---

<!-- 214. ALTER TABLE: Modifying Columns -->

# ALTER TABLE: Modifying Columns

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211032845-2d096b1d-2907-4624-b3d2-edcd24bd544d.png)

In this section, we are looking at how we can modify existing columns, not their name, but modify the actual column definition.

In the above example, we are modyfying the biz_name column within the `suppliers` table. We are changing the biz_name column to be VARCHAR(100).

---

Also, need to be careful when usng this to modify a text column to an INT column or vice versa or changing a DATE column into something else.

---

A simple example is if we had a column which could hold `NULL` values or if we wanted a column to be able to hold more, or less, characters, we would:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211033912-bdf9bc61-1ec2-4e28-86d7-4431eb30112f.png)

Here, we can see that the name column can hold 255 characters. Let's say we wanted to decrease this to 100 and also included a DEFAULT value.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211035117-4d6a35b8-e2b9-4b9f-860e-64634dfefac6.png)

We can see now that the name column has been updated to VARCHAR(100) and Defaultis set to Unknow.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211035608-626265ac-eb7f-4b48-be79-6a2334a6d1d6.png)

Now when enter data into this table, if we don't include data for the name column, it will revert back to default instead of NULL.

So that's how you can modify a column by changing its type. There's also a second option.

---

# CHANGE 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211035864-67be7bb3-d109-4e88-90a6-a7150eaf7392.png)

If you wanted to rename a column and also change its definition, you can use `CHANGE`.

```sql
ALTER TABLE suppliers
CHANGE business biz_name VARCHAR(50);
```

With `CHANGE`, we first specify the `old_column_name`, then the `new_column_name` and then change its definition.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211038323-b6eb837c-43dd-4638-a7a2-150f5e109182.png)

In `MODIFY`, we don't have the opportunity to change the name of a column. But it's simpler. We only need to provide the current name and the new definition for that current named column. 


---

<!-- L216. ALTER TABLE: Constraints -->

# ALTER TABLE: Constraints

Here, we are looking at is how we can add constraints and drop constraints after a table is created.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211041214-f57524f1-40a7-44c1-82ab-755a4dd3a113.png)

In this table, we have a column which is called `worker_count`. At the moment we can input negative numbers within this column. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211042217-fbcb7f5e-3a4e-41e5-963c-3779fdd95094.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211043774-d7b988fe-1fc4-4e58-b3d3-089fab1dc867.png)

Now when we try to add an entry which has a negative number for the worker_count column, it causes an error.

`positive_number` is the constraint we just added. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211044357-d87406e3-1045-4067-a1cd-749157b4b3ef.png)

And the entry is NOT added to the table.

---

# Dropping a Constraint

We can also drop a constraint using `DROP`. For example: 

```sql
ALTER TABLE companies DROP CONSTRAINT positive_number;
```

After `DROP CONSTRAINT` we use the name of the actual constraint we want to drop.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/211044920-13445ff9-a2cf-4109-aa7f-fa7d74019549.png)

We can now see that we can input a negative number for the `worker_count` column.
