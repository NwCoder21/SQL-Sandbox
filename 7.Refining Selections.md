# Refining Selections

In this section will be focusing on some more advanced MySQL features, things like limiting the number of results that we get back. For example, instead of 500 results,  maybe we want only want five results to be returned.

Then will also cover how to sort our results. Maybe by sales, alphbetically or by genre for example.

<!-- Lesson 112 - Adding Some New Books --> 

# Adding Some New Books

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207892525-a0acd893-2939-4de8-a40d-148dadab08ad.png)

Add some more entries to the book table. 

```sql
INSERT INTO books
    (title, author_fname, author_lname, released_year, stock_quantity, pages)
    VALUES ('10% Happier', 'Dan', 'Harris', 2014, 29, 256), 
           ('fake_book', 'Freida', 'Harris', 2001, 287, 428),
           ('Lincoln In The Bardo', 'George', 'Saunders', 2017, 1000, 367);
```

---

<!-- Lesson 114 - DISTINCT--> 

# `DISTINCT`

`DISTINCT` allows us to return only unique results and removes duplicate results.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207893260-99735fbf-43f0-4c9b-9f13-78e881c73443.png)

This is what a typical DISTINCT statement looks like.

IMPORTANT: `DISTINCT` comes after `SELECT` and before a column name. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207893764-5c04455e-3b35-41ef-91cc-655deec14efd.png)

Here we can see duplicate results, such as Gaiman, Eggers, Foster Wallace, Harris.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207894122-1c70bba4-1891-4377-8fa9-842b1e75e62b.png)
 
 Using `SELECT DISTINCT author_lname FROM books;` we will now only get one of each. 

---

Another example is:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207894479-c61859da-d70b-4a12-979a-55e3eed134e3.png)

Here, we have duplicates of 2001, 2003. 

---

By using `DISTINCT`, we can only have unique results returned.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207895783-e682cf24-eadf-40ca-8cac-bbb19282396c.png)

# How do we get DISTINCT Author Full Names?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207899165-a9dabf4e-8223-4c2d-9cca-94e4c057ddbd.png)

At the moment, when we run: 

```sql
SELECT author_fname, author_lname FROM books;
```

we get several results which have the same last name, for example Dan Harris and Freida Harris. At moment, when we run `SELECT DISTINCT author_lname FROM books;`, we lose one of them. SO, how do we get DISTINCT author full names?

Two ways to do this:

1. Using CONCAT: so, concat first name and last name with a space in between and then find the DISTINCT results of this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207900412-40811300-e39e-4206-95c2-9c28ab23f38f.png)

And then we only want the DISTINCT of these results because at the moment, 'David Foster Wallace', 'Neil Gaiman', 'Dave Eggers', 'Raymond Carver' have dupliccates. 
Whereas, 'Dan Harris' and 'Freida Harris' would now be considered unique. 


---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207902007-114582f8-58f6-4d39-8f58-a9e538241024.png)

we can then add DISTINCT to get only unique results.

---

2. Use DISTINCT on the first name column only. 


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207903833-ee6ea91c-b2ee-4a4f-a9f1-79ca90a7d807.png)

This is saying to select the distinct first name and last name combinations.

---


<!-- Lesson 116 - ORDER BY--> 

# ORDER BY

In this lesson we will learn how to sort our data. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207905568-7ee6635c-ffff-4548-a898-ed97c7ba3502.png)

At the moment, data is sorted but according to the order the data is in the database. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207906684-ec96e158-68bb-483b-9ca1-9fefd1f3f564.png)

For example, if we add another entry to the table, it goes to the bottom.

But let's say we want to order it according to something else, such as by the year or alphabetically, etc. The way we can do this is by using `ORDER BY`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207907231-f0954238-93a4-4dc3-ae78-e35797f7f84d.png)

It comes after the SElECT, (after whatever we want to select). After the `ORDER BY`, we will have a column name. 

---

For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207908768-a24886d7-98fb-4345-943c-8fa3e77f177b.png)

This is sorted, by default, by book_id.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207908919-aa83759a-4231-424e-8384-b154271f9b75.png)

However, now we have ordered it according to the release year. 

```sql
SELECT book_id, title, author_fname, author_lname, released_year FROM books
ORDER BY released_year;
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207912688-f734fb1d-5fde-47cb-bcfe-e9b731d102eb.png)


Here, we have sorted the results according to the author's last name in ascending order.


---

# `DESC`

IMPORTANT: By default, `ORDER BY` sorts by ASCENDING. Alphabetically that means going from A to Z, numerically that means from 0 onwards.

We can change this by:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207910609-345713c3-a6bf-45c3-b45a-e75de8cfe8f8.png)

specyfying `DESC` (descending order). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207911780-1047cc1b-ba21-4223-b121-60dd09de5764.png)

We can now see that the results are sorted in descending order according to the year.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207912908-bbc8c310-bbe3-401d-b90c-650a1f305680.png)

In this example, we have sorted the results according to the author's last name in descending order. 

---

# `ASC`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207912405-fcdc4492-4ea6-439f-b233-0fc546c5b56a.png)

Can use `ASC` to sort results in Ascending order.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207915588-11088561-3b6c-471d-a5df-ee6782acd2c3.png)

What happens if we order by the `released_year` but don't even select `released_year` in the SELECT query. Well, we can check by adding it to the `SELECT` query:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207916613-f01e47b7-2c41-4f48-8b43-d79818d9f26a.png)

We can see the output stays the same. This means even if we don't select a column in the SELECT statement, it will still sort by that column if we reference it after the `ORDER BY` statement. 

This is probably not that common to sort by or order by some column that you're not even selecting because you won't be able to see the values that you're sorting by, but you can do it.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208117703-93220ca7-ba0f-4af8-8fa5-7e751c9de301.png)

We may come across something like this, `ORDER BY` followed by a number. Basically, it is a shorthand syntax that says ordered by the second column that we're selecting.

So in the above example, it means `ORDER BY` `author_fname`

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208119316-288df4f8-9e1a-4c51-b482-f973c6c299ac.png)

In this example, we are ordering by the `released_year` as this is the third column in the `SELECT` column. 

---

The other option to order by released_year would have been:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208121316-751f50a1-eaaa-4b4f-8850-4cd9b85a497e.png)

Same output as before, however slightly longer to write. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208122224-aafb5b8b-2c97-42b3-a695-666502cb2d78.png)

Can still use `ASC` or `DESC` even when using a number after `ORDER BY`.

---

# Ordering by Multiple Columns   

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208122435-400f8880-776a-4ad8-902a-12638d4fccfe.png)

Can also order by multiple columns.

When we do this, we'll sort by one column first and then secondly, we'll sort by the second column and so on. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208123814-67d5db94-d7d0-4775-81ed-e758cf861845.png)

Here, we have results which have not yet been sorted. Now let's sort them by author's last name:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208124450-e61572c4-326a-4be5-88ac-f1a4313f7b7a.png)

We have now ordered them according to author's last name, however, each grouping's dates are still not in order. So, we can 'Order by Multiple Columns' to further sort this data out according to the date they were released:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208124985-fd0ed4b5-1bde-4963-8738-a6f978c5de6d.png)

> So secondarily, I could add on `released_year` after `author_lname` in my `ORDER BY`.

Now the data is ordered by author's last name and then once each authors names have been grouped, the rowsare ordered according to the release year. 

In other words, each grouping, such as Eggers, Carver, etc, has now been ordered according to release year.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208125697-28ed5948-6eb6-409f-8190-d320f00a04dd.png)

In 

```sql
SELECT title, author_lname, released_year FROM books 
ORDER BY author_lname, released_year DESC;
```
We are still sorting according to ascending for `author_lname`, that happens first, all the rows are going to be ordered by `author_lname`, alphabetically A to Z. And then after that we will sort by `released_year` and this is descending.

---

# Referencing Aliases (`AS`) in `ORDER BY` Statements

Next thing to learn about `ORDER BY` is that we can also order by columns that aren't necessarily part of the table, but our results are values that we've asked SQL for.

In other words, we can sort by aliases (`AS`) we have creeted for the results.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208127136-6f6f921e-149b-4d7b-aff1-487aa33aea02.png)

In this example, we are referencing `Author` which is an alias which we have created in the `ORDER BY` statement. 

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(author_fname,' ',author_lname ) AS Author FROM books;
```
---

<!-- Lesson 120 - LIMIT -->

# `LIMIT`

`LIMIT` allows us to control the number of results we get back. Mostly used when we are also sorting, so can use both of them together or on their own too. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208128416-a60683ce-3c67-44e1-8a69-3956e170b6d5.png)

`LIMIT`, followed by a number, will limit the number of results we get back.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208128770-1f1a22a4-78d5-4968-a583-70ff33554dec.png)

Here, we get all the rows back. However, if we use `LIMIT`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208128886-a68558be-3c94-48f1-b0a8-c3e92da1b456.png)

We only get the first 5 results back. 

```sql
SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname, released_year FROM books
LIMIT 5;
```
---

But at moment, this only outputs the first 5 results from the database table. However, what if we wanted to view the the earliest five released books? 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208129417-734574f6-4e10-43e7-a362-ccccf4d26973.png)

We can sort them first and then limit them to the first 5 results, such as:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208129534-25bf87da-6482-4825-8be7-d2db84d17c26.png)

Now we get the first 5 results.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208130829-dfc111d6-2e28-440b-b813-4100af6f53c5.png)

Can still use `DESC` with `ORDER BY`.

---

Normally would use `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`. If showing example, then may just use `LIMIT` on its own. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208132159-b59a7730-ea7d-49a4-a0f2-887123474079.png)

We can also provide `LIMIT` two numbers seperated by a comma like in the above example. 

The first number represents the index/(starting row) we want our results to start from and the second number represents the count, how many rows we want in our results.

If we use `LIMIT 0,5`, it is the same as `LIMIT 5`. For example, the below two examples are the same output

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208132964-0a4c8e65-d2b7-402d-a752-dc46ba4f84b3.png)

This one uses `LIMIT 7`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208133070-01161d35-9ff0-4108-bb95-2c0a9aafa49e.png)

This one uses `LIMIT 0,7`.

---

However, in

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208133366-fe797fe5-5024-4525-9e18-6293b0fa5c9c.png)

```sql
SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname, released_year FROM books
ORDER BY released_year DESC
LIMIT 1,7;
```
means that start from the 1st index, not the 0 index and outout 7 results.

---

<!-- Lesson 122 - LIKE -->

# Wildcard - `LIKE`

This helps to perform basic searching. SO far, we have learnt, in order to search for something, we can use `WHERE`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208135787-49ed7ecd-967a-462e-ad02-c5c52c03d855.png)

Here, we are searching for entries which have `David` in the `author_fname` column.

---

However, the issue with this is that it has to be an exact match. So if we did `Dav`: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208138121-d4b362ac-fd2e-4cc4-bc4b-e2741d132840.png)

it would not work.

---

This is where `LIKE` comes in. We don't need to know the exact match.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208138337-a3f0ced4-1dc4-4b7c-ad1d-b601ed166f2f.png)

We will use `LIKE` followed by a string which has two `%` symbols. These symbols are wildards. They both, the first `%` and the last `%`, mean any number of characters (0 or more).  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208138572-cc9b85d1-eb5c-4d08-89a9-20321f514d79.png)

---

In this example, `'%da%'` means: 

* there is 0 or more characters 
* then there is a `da`
* and then 0 or more characters 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208139345-89ed06a3-47d2-48c8-9512-02f71fccd8e1.png)

Now we have found all authors first name which contain `da` in them.

---

Another example is if we wanted to search for titles which contain a `:`. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208139820-19be623d-b4cb-49bc-9679-cbc6116a759f.png)

Here, we are looking for any title which contains a `:` anywhere in the title, no matter if it is a the start, middle or end of the name.

---

# Wildcard - `____`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208140200-8bffce79-fa18-419c-82c2-4c97d929c6eb.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208142202-567352a9-5058-4f0a-bdec-2c7647c88058.png)

Each underscore represents a character. This is helpful when we know the length of the string we are looking for but no idea of what the string is made up out of.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208142250-4e08cdbb-452c-4a7d-9bfe-0ef4b83360de.png)

Another example. In this one, we are looking for author first names which are 5 chracters long.

---

You use the underscores if you know, with precise detail, that what you're looking for is something of a certain number of characters.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208142725-1a8d9cc7-7527-442a-a588-af0715872405.png)

This searches for three characters long author first name where the 2nd letter is a `a`.

---

Let's say we are looking for names which end with the letter `n`. We can do: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208143030-cce5cadb-e1b0-4a4b-a2a9-40d6e61e88fa.png)

We won't use a `%` after the `n` as that is to be the last letter in our desired results.

---

<!-- Lesson 124 - Escaping Wildcards -->

# Escaping Wildcards

Let's say we are searching for a string which has a `%` or `_` in it. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208402900-db41eda5-c29b-4153-9349-9155fb632196.png)

If we use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE title LIKE '%';
```

it will return everything as the `%` matches everything.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208403474-d1a33223-2636-4c0d-aa23-0c456726f8f2.png)

So, to find a string with actually a `%` in it, we can use:

```sql
LIKE `%\%%`
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208403756-45cf2cff-48b9-4034-9941-6f29dc4fa390.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE title LIKE '%\%%';
```

Now we can specfically search for a string which has a `%` in it. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208404466-aebc16d9-47d4-4f1c-8a8b-22f5b13ff22a.png)


Likewise, if we wanted to search for a string which contains a `_`, we can use 

```sql
LIKE `%\_%`
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/208404606-d2343c67-6893-4415-9074-f1c17c3160f3.png)
