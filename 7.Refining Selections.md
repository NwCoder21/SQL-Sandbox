# Refining Selections

In this section will be focusing on some more advanced MySQL features, things like limiting the number of results that we get back. For example, instead of 500 results,  maybe we want only want five results to be returned.

Then will also cover how to sort our results. Maybe by sales, alphbetically or by genre for example.

# Adding Some New Books

Add some more entries to the book table. 

```sql
INSERT INTO books
    (title, author_fname, author_lname, released_year, stock_quantity, pages)
    VALUES ('10% Happier', 'Dan', 'Harris', 2014, 29, 256), 
           ('fake_book', 'Freida', 'Harris', 2001, 287, 428),
           ('Lincoln In The Bardo', 'George', 'Saunders', 2017, 1000, 367);
```

<!-- Lesson 114 - DISTINCT--> 

# `DISTINCT`

`DISTINCT` allows us to return only unique results and removes duplicate results.

This is what a typical DISTINCT statement looks like.

IMPORTANT: `DISTINCT` comes after `SELECT` and before a column name.

Here we can see duplicate results, such as Gaiman, Eggers, Foster Wallace, Harris.

 Using `SELECT DISTINCT author_lname FROM books;` we will now only get one of each.

Another example is:

Here, we have duplicates of 2001, 2003. 

---

By using `DISTINCT`, we can only have unique results returned.
