# 5 - CRUD Basics

CRUD stands for:

* Create - how to create an entry - `INSERT INTO`
* Read - how to read an entry - `SELECT FROM `
* Update - How do we alter a row that already exists?
* Delete - How do we delete rows?

These are the four basic actions that we want to be able to do wth our data.

Until now, we have looked at how to create entries using the `INSERT INTO` command and retrieve entries using the `SELECT` commmand.
