On the right, we have a collection of databases already set up with data in them. We can use these to practise. However, we will install MySQL locally as then we can do more with it. 

We can interact with the data in databases by writing some basic queries. This is how we work with SQL.

We can run queries to get results. Those queries can do different things. We can ask to find information, find the highest selling item in our database, or delete the lowest selling items, or add a new item or update an item to price. We can interact with the database via these queries that we write and then execute.

# What is a Database? 

There are two parts to this question 

1. It is a collection of data. For example, a list of items to purchase at the store, or medical records at a doctoers surgery. Another example is a phonebook. Usually ordered in alphabetically order by the surname.

However, if we needed to find a number by the first name, or using the Area Code, it will be much mroe difficult.

2. A method to access and manipulate that data.

Going back to the phone book, we would want some sort of program or code that would allow us to do things such as find everybody with the first name Ned, or find all people who have a three letter first name, or even do things like add a new person into the phonebook, or change area codes, or change phone numbers, or delete people from our phone book or delete everybody.

So, we need soem sort of program which allows us to interface with the data.
