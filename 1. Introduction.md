On the right, we have a collection of databases already set up with data in them. We can use these to practise. However, we will install MySQL locally as then we can do more with it. 

We can interact with the data in databases by writing some basic queries. This is how we work with SQL.

We can run queries to get results. Those queries can do different things. We can ask to find information, find the highest selling item in our database, or delete the lowest selling items, or add a new item or update an item to price. We can interact with the database via these queries that we write and then execute.

# What is a Database? 

There are two parts to this question 

1. It is a collection of data. For example, a list of items to purchase at the store, or medical records at a doctoers surgery. Another example is a phonebook. Usually ordered in alphabetically order by the surname.

However, if we needed to find a number by the first name, or using the Area Code, it will be much mroe difficult.

2. A method to access and manipulate that data.

Going back to the phone book, we would want some sort of program or code that would allow us to do things such as find everybody with the first name Ned, or find all people who have a three letter first name, or even do things like add a new person into the phonebook, or change area codes, or change phone numbers, or delete people from our phone book or delete everybody.

So, we need soem sort of program which allows us to interface with the data.

# Database Vs Database Management System 

In simple terms, a database is a group of tables which contains the data. A database management system suuch as a an app which stores student records. In order for the application to be able to update, delete or add new student records, we need to have a DBMS (database management system) that allows us to interface with the database.

> Note: DBMS is just the code or the program that does the talking to our database for us. We talk to our database management system and it talks to the database.

Normally, when people talk about a database, you actually hear them referring to both of these things, the DBMS and Database together. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/204834694-6923965d-7a71-4ac1-b73e-af03b6d5afbe.png)

PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, MySQL, and SQLite are Database Management Systems. 

So, when people say things like MySQL is one of the most commonly used databases, it's actually one of the most commonly used database management systems.

This is important to understand as when we start to write code in order to interact with the database, it will help you understand what you're doing is that you are giving commands to this database management system, which then goes and gives commands to the actual data itself or to the database itself.

<!-- Lesson 8 - SQL Vs MySQL -->

# SQL Vs MySQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/204836103-c0dd9d78-d334-4d30-99bf-514f6018d7aa.png)

SQL is the way that we interact and access the data, update data, delete , and manipulate the data in our databases. SQL is the language we use.

---

SOme of the thingd SQL allows us to do with our databases is:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/204836492-3f9a8169-2ab1-4823-bd91-f4ba95c7d054.png)

To do things like this, we write these lines/code, which are called queries (hence, the name structured query language) and then execute the code by pressing ENTER. 

A simple example is:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/204837008-f1134e7c-4acf-4046-a1e5-68bbab01230a.png)

When the user presses ENTER to execute this query, the query is sent of to interact with the database

When we work with MySQL, we're actually writing SQL all the time.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/204837620-e8fd6324-f29e-4438-aa62-ffe0b2c8ca77.png)

MySQL is a Database Management System, and there are many others, for example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/204837728-648b43c4-9db9-4a9d-baf4-4626a84ac206.png)

The above are some common Database Management Systems. These systems use SQL. SQL is a standard that these relational database management systems, like my SQL implement.

> Remember: when we we use a database management system like MySQL, we'll actually be writing SQL.

---

Example of what a line of SQL code looks like to do the exact same thing in a MySQL database and a PostgreSQL database...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/204839623-c2f87740-6a3f-436b-81d9-a4945514c3a8.png)

They are the identical. Both of these are different database management systems. They have differences to them, but they both use SQL. You will be writing SQL when you interact with these databases.

> There is a slight difference in syntax from one DBMS to another which will be covered later. However, more or less the same for the most part. All the different DBMS are tasked with implementing the SQL Standard in their own database.
> There is a SQL Standard which can eb read online.

# Two Main Points to Takeaway 

1. Once you learn SQL, it's really not that hard to switch to another database that also uses SQL. So, if learnt MySQL, won't be too hard to switch over to PostgreSQL or SQLite.
2. What makes database management system are the features they offer, not the SQL language itself. Things such as how secure they are, how fast they are or how user permissions work?

---

To Summarise: SQL is structured query language. It exists separately from MySQL. 
And my SQL is a database management system that implements SQL.
