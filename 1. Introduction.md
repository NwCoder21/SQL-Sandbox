On the right, we have a collection of databases already set up with data in them. We can use these to practise. However, we will install MySQL locally as then we can do more with it. 

We can interact with the data in databases by writing some basic queries. This is how we work with SQL.

We can run queries, get results, those queries can do different things. We can ask to find information, find the highest selling item in our database, or delete the lowest selling items, or add a new item or update an item to price. We can interact with the database via these queries that we write and then execute.
