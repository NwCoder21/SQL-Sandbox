# Many to Many

Many to many is is common as well. Maybe not as common, but still very, very common.

These are some of the examples of Many to Many relationships.

---

A book can have multiple authors and each author can write multiple books. 

Or another common example is blog post. Each blog  post can have multiple tags and each tag can be assignedto multiple blogs.

Another example is students. Each student can be given multiple classes to attend and each type of class will have multiple students attending it.

In this section, imagine that we're building a TV show reviewing application.
Idea is that we can have someone who signs up as a reviewer. And each reviewer can then rate any of the TV series on the database.

---

To accomplish this many to many relationship, we need to use three tables. We use what's known as a join table or a union table.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213035997-85fd9e63-9b7b-413e-8b70-37beabfed4ce.png)

At the top we will have the Series data (`TV shows` table) and at the bottom we will have the `Reviewers` data/table such as their name.

But the way that they're connected is through a third table. Through a `Reviews` table.

This reviews table will have information on the TV show that's being reviewed and then the reviewer who is doing it, as well as a third piece of information, which is the rating which will be a numeric representation of that review.

# Schema for the TV Shows Reviews database 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213036537-6ef772d6-947f-4be6-948e-cde3bb6c3d40.png)

We have three tables: 

* `Reviewers`: `id` will be primary key.
* `Series`: `id` will be primary key. `title` will be the name of the TV show. For `genre`, we will only have animation, comedy and drama.
* `Reviews`: through this table, the `Reviewers` and the `Series` tables will be joined. The table we use to join other tables is known as a join or union table.


The way the `Reviews` table connects the other table is:

The `series_id` will be a foreign key to the `Series` table. So, this will allow it to tell what series is being referrenced in the `Series` table.

And the reviewer_id will be a foreign key pointing to the the `id` field in the `Reviewers` table.

This means the `Reviews` table will be a centralized table where for our information to be stored.

Looking at the `Reviews` table on its own, it's actually going to be very confusing. It's not going to make sense as it will only contain numbers for each column. So we'll have to use joins to be able to understand things.  For example, to replace `series_id` with the name of the series so that it says, for example, Fargo, instead of 1.

Here's a simple example with some simple data. Very simple data with two reviewers.

We can see from the `Reviews` table, that `reviewer_id` of 1 reviewed `series_id` of 2 with a rating of 8.9. Using the `Reviewers` table, we can see that `reviewer_id` of 1 is Blue Steele, and using the `Series` table, we can see that `series_id` of 2 is the TV show Fargo.

Let's go ahead and write these three tables.

First, we will create the `reviewers` table.

# Creating the Tables

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213053824-724763ba-4dff-4e08-8b48-a099a3e76df7.png)

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tv_db;

USE tv_db;
```


`Reviewers` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE reviewers (
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
first_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL
);
```

---

`series` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE series (
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
title VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL,
released_year YEAR,
genre VARCHAR (100)
);
```

---

`reviews` table: 

```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
rating DECIMAL(2,1),
series_id INT,
reviewer_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (series_id) REFERENCES series(id),
FOREIGN KEY (reviewer_id) REFERENCES reviewers(id)
)
```

---

# Side Notes on the Tables

Called the database `tv_db` (TV database).

# Data Type YEAR

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213045256-45a13b89-3ab0-4cb4-abad-e07a6d870ddb.png)

* Note: for `released_year` in the `series` table, we useda data type called `YEAR`. It will display and hold the value of a year implicitly with a width of four characters. 

* Also, `rating DECIMAL(2,1)`: for `rating` in the `reviews` table, we used `DECIMAL` as the data type and limited it to be two total characters, one of which is after the the decimal point.

* `FOREIGN KEY (series_id) REFERENCES series(id)`: means that we are telling MySQL that we want to add a FOREIGN KEY Constraint and that `series_id` is a `FOREIGN KEY` and it `REFERENCES` the `series` table (`id`) column.

* `FOREIGN KEY (reviewer_id) REFERENCES reviewers(id)` means that we are telling MySQL that we want to add a FOREIGN KEY Constraint and that `reviewer_id` is a `FOREIGN KEY` and it `REFERENCES` the `reviewers` table (`id`) column.

* We also have the option to add `DELETE CASCADE` or not. Meaning if a series is deleted, should its reviews be deleted, or if a reviewer deletes their account, do the reviews associated with that account go away? For now, we'll say no, because maybe we want to keep if somebody deletes their account, we might want to keep the review and we'll just display it with no user name associated with it. But that is a choice that we have.

`show tables;` shows us that the tables have indeed been created.

# Adding Data to the Tables 

Inserting data into the `reviewers` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO reviewers (first_name, last_name) VALUES
    ('Thomas', 'Stoneman'),
    ('Wyatt', 'Skaggs'),
    ('Kimbra', 'Masters'),
    ('Domingo', 'Cortes'),
    ('Colt', 'Steele'),
    ('Pinkie', 'Petit'),
    ('Marlon', 'Crafford');
    
    SELECT * FROM reviewers;
```

    ("Bob's Burgers", 2011, 'Animation'),
    ('Bojack Horseman', 2014, 'Animation'),
