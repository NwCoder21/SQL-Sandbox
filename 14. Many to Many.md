# Many to Many

Many to many is is common as well. Maybe not as common, but still very, very common.

These are some of the examples of Many to Many relationships.

---

A book can have multiple authors and each author can write multiple books. 

Or another common example is blog post. Each blog  post can have multiple tags and each tag can be assignedto multiple blogs.

Another example is students. Each student can be given multiple classes to attend and each type of class will have multiple students attending it.

In this section, imagine that we're building a TV show reviewing application.
Idea is that we can have someone who signs up as a reviewer. And each reviewer can then rate any of the TV series on the database.

---

To accomplish this many to many relationship, we need to use three tables. We use what's known as a join table or a union table.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213035997-85fd9e63-9b7b-413e-8b70-37beabfed4ce.png)

At the top we will have the Series data (`TV shows` table) and at the bottom we will have the `Reviewers` data/table such as their name.

But the way that they're connected is through a third table. Through a `Reviews` table.

This reviews table will have information on the TV show that's being reviewed and then the reviewer who is doing it, as well as a third piece of information, which is the rating which will be a numeric representation of that review.

---

# Schema for the TV Shows Reviews database 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213036537-6ef772d6-947f-4be6-948e-cde3bb6c3d40.png)

We have three tables: 

* `Reviewers`: `id` will be primary key.
* `Series`: `id` will be primary key. `title` will be the name of the TV show. For `genre`, we will only have animation, comedy and drama.
* `Reviews`: through this table, the `Reviewers` and the `Series` tables will be joined. The table we use to join other tables is known as a join or union table.


The way the `Reviews` table connects the other table is:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213037791-b726dc37-2470-46f6-9815-291b20677c1f.png)

The `series_id` will be a foreign key to the `Series` table. So, this will allow it to tell what series is being referrenced in the `Series` table.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213038002-9518d3c4-2749-4302-a3bb-4aa5e5d266ec.png)

And the reviewer_id will be a foreign key pointing to the the `id` field in the `Reviewers` table.

This means the `Reviews` table will be a centralized table where for our information to be stored.

Looking at the `Reviews` table on its own, it's actually going to be very confusing. It's not going to make sense as it will only contain numbers for each column. So we'll have to use joins to be able to understand things.  For example, to replace `series_id` with the name of the series so that it says, for example, Fargo, instead of 1.


---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213038609-a4074b99-4df2-4f27-95e7-1740aebaf0a8.png)

Here's a simple example with some simple data. Very simple data with two reviewers.

We can see from the `Reviews` table, that `reviewer_id` of 1 reviewed `series_id` of 2 with a rating of 8.9. Using the `Reviewers` table, we can see that `reviewer_id` of 1 is Blue Steele, and using the `Series` table, we can see that `series_id` of 2 is the TV show Fargo.

Let's go ahead and write these three tables.

First, we will create the `reviewers` table.

# Creating the Tables

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213053824-724763ba-4dff-4e08-8b48-a099a3e76df7.png)

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tv_db;

USE tv_db;
```


`Reviewers` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE reviewers (
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
first_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL
);
```

---

`series` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE series (
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
title VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL,
released_year YEAR,
genre VARCHAR (100)
);
```

---

`reviews` table: 

```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
rating DECIMAL(2,1),
series_id INT,
reviewer_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (series_id) REFERENCES series(id),
FOREIGN KEY (reviewer_id) REFERENCES reviewers(id)
)
```

---

# Side Notes on the Tables

Called the database `tv_db` (TV database).

# Data Type YEAR

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213045256-45a13b89-3ab0-4cb4-abad-e07a6d870ddb.png)

* Note: for `released_year` in the `series` table, we useda data type called `YEAR`. It will display and hold the value of a year implicitly with a width of four characters. 

* Also, `rating DECIMAL(2,1)`: for `rating` in the `reviews` table, we used `DECIMAL` as the data type and limited it to be two total characters, one of which is after the the decimal point.

* `FOREIGN KEY (series_id) REFERENCES series(id)`: means that we are telling MySQL that we want to add a FOREIGN KEY Constraint and that `series_id` is a `FOREIGN KEY` and it `REFERENCES` the `series` table (`id`) column.

* `FOREIGN KEY (reviewer_id) REFERENCES reviewers(id)` means that we are telling MySQL that we want to add a FOREIGN KEY Constraint and that `reviewer_id` is a `FOREIGN KEY` and it `REFERENCES` the `reviewers` table (`id`) column.

* We also have the option to add `DELETE CASCADE` or not. Meaning if a series is deleted, should its reviews be deleted, or if a reviewer deletes their account, do the reviews associated with that account go away? For now, we'll say no, because maybe we want to keep if somebody deletes their account, we might want to keep the review and we'll just display it with no user name associated with it. But that is a choice that we have.

`show tables;` shows us that the tables have indeed been created.

Inserting data into the `reviews` table:

```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213054590-07360dad-e819-4fca-b8cc-480b1f102728.png)

When we look at this reviews table on its own, it's pretty meaningless unless you happen to know what series has the `id`, for example, of nine, and what reviewer has the `id`, for example, of 5. You're not going to know who left this review and what show it corresponds to, but that's the whole point of this section. We're going to get practice using some joins, but we have the data to be able to do that now.

Next, we're going to work on a series of challenges to get meaningful information from these tables.

---

# TV Series Challenge #1

Write a query which results in: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213146121-f857b8e8-aa1e-4fa0-ab29-1fe6ebe949d8.png)

Recreate the same columns, the same relationship and information, but don't need to limit it to 15 rows.

In the above results, we have title and every review left for it.

We know that we need to do a join because we don't have these two pieces of information in the same table.

---

We'll start by getting just the titles ... 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213146796-9ae35388-c44f-4f49-a866-d1c4fa2ce736.png)

---

Now we also need the ratings which comes from another table, the `reviews` table, the `rating` column ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213147277-c8341a11-b4de-4a6e-8e61-d6ecb6612b23.png)


---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213147626-6d6903c6-6f0e-471e-99bf-4cee3d1a5506.png)

We want to take `rating` from the reviews table and match each row up to a series where the `series_id` in the `reviews` table matches up with an `id` in the `series` table.

In other words, for example, the first row in the `reviews` table, we want to take the `8.0` which has a `series_id` of 1 and we want to put that alongside the series that actually has the `id` of 1 in the `series` table. This is going to require a join.
We don't need to worry about a left or right join. We want the overlap.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213150064-45021cb0-071a-41e1-a99e-c779e5e39a80.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM series 
JOIN reviews ON reviews.series_id = series.id;
```

We can see from the results that `series_id` from the `reviews` table matches the `id` from the `series` table. 

---

However, all we want is the title and rating ... 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213150149-1bf29a25-2428-4f78-b85a-64990a7ae42e.png)

```sql
SELECT title, rating FROM series 
JOIN reviews ON reviews.series_id = series.id;
```

We see every rating that's been made for every show that we have. So every `title` alongside every `rating`. We're not doing an average.

That is a solution to this first challenge.

---

<!-- L 248 TV Series Challenge #2 -->

# TV Series Challenge #2

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213151694-90b0bd8f-ffe2-42b8-be48-f64e02abbf11.png)

In this task, we are trying to find the average rating for each of our TV series that we have. And then we want it to be ordered from lowest to highest.

In the above results, we have the `title` of every show, along with all of the reviews left for that show, grouped together, averaged and sorted.

This involves a couple of things: 

* Will have to use a `GROUP BY`
* Will need a JOIN
* WIll need `ORDER BY`
* Will need `AVG`

---

Solution: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213152537-984be48d-e263-4ea7-a5c2-c4783e127ac7.png)

```sql
SELECT title, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating FROM series
JOIN reviews ON reviews.series_id = series.id
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY avg_rating;
```

We want to group them together by `title` so that we can average the `rating`s. We have to use `AVG` as each title has multiple ratings, so, we want to average all the ratings for each group and print that average out. 

---

In the solution below, have used `ROUND` to round off the numbers.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213154541-2643e050-d7b0-4c2a-a98a-a2d4d1bfaa81.png)

```sql
SELECT title, ROUND(AVG(rating),1) AS avg_rating FROM series
JOIN reviews ON reviews.series_id = series.id
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY avg_rating;
```

`ORDER BY avg_rating;` this orders results from lowest to highest.

This time we're working with the reviewers table and the reviews table. We want the first name and last name of every reviewer matched up with any rating they have left which would be stored in the reviews table. We won't worry about series because there's no series information here.

Solution: 

Let's start with this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213722239-8bc15120-828c-41b3-a6fd-d84fe39e4ec8.png)

Here, we just see information from the `reviewers` table.

And we are going to match up these `id`s from the `reviewers` table with the `reviewer_id` in the `reviews` table ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213722649-6dd4e5cf-31a0-401a-9a0a-54fc69b651b4.png)

This is what the `reviews` table looks like.

---

 And then we want to take the rating from each of row in the `reviews` table once we have joined `reviews` and `reviewers` table together.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213723613-8e400487-f9ab-4d0b-b79b-8e0a2e6a78da.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM reviewers
JOIN reviews ON reviewers.id = reviews.reviewer_id;
```

Now we see every time there is a match between the `reviewer_id` from the `reviews` table and `id` from the `reviewers` table. This is what we want. 

---

All we want though is, the first name and last name of every reviewer matched up with any rating ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213724145-3f2df325-b65b-4465-89c3-9a7c3d76bf9b.png)

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, rating FROM reviewers
JOIN reviews ON reviewers.id = reviews.reviewer_id;
```

Here is the final solution.

---

# TV Series Challenge #4

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213725087-8374c4ce-5db8-4930-872f-209358f76a13.png)

 We need to identify the series that have no reviews. So how are we going to do that? Well, we need to use a join and it's not going to be an inner join.

We'll need to join the `series` table with the `reviews` table and then see where there are series that have no reviews, i.e., where some value is null.

---

SO, let's first start off with: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213726894-f2803c19-d878-4875-840c-0d04683acc71.png)

```sql
SELECT* FROM series
JOIN reviews ON series.id = reviews.series_id;
```

this only gives us the exact overlap. Only the series that have a review are joined with the review.

---

But what we want is actually a left join in our case because we want all of the `series` information and then any corresponding `reviews` information. So:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213727474-a46687b5-b3ee-4502-94e1-1766df419b63.png)

```sql
SELECT* FROM series
LEFT JOIN reviews ON series.id = reviews.series_id;
```

shows us all columns from this left table, which, in this case, is the `series` table. Where the left table row has no informaiton in the right tabel, which is the reviews table in this case, it will show `NULL`.

---

So now all we need to do is only select the ones that have `NULL` and just get their title. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213730121-dd961d76-ea6f-430a-896d-f80c773505c1.png)

```sql
SELECT title FROM series
LEFT JOIN reviews ON series.id = reviews.series_id
WHERE rating IS NULL;
```

when writing `WHERE rating IS NULL;` we could have chosen any column from the `reviews` table which contained `NULL`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213730483-e4181578-5261-409d-9c2c-6cf4bd9c3ded.png)

We can then also add an Alias like so.

#  TV Series Challenge #5

So we're finding the average rating for each of the genres.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213731118-f173be4a-5e9e-4bb0-863f-b2ee911ecc79.png)

So, we only want to return the `genre` cloumn from the `series` table.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213731314-56df8de4-7463-4192-9466-9898d42aabae.png)

And only the `ratings` column from the `reviews` table. And we will also need to `group by` genre , and then do some operation to find the average rating.

---

Solution:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213736211-a1e9f3f8-d230-4f53-9dab-46e10794b920.png)

```sql
SELECT genre, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating FROM series
JOIN reviews ON reviews.series_id = series.id
GROUP BY genre;
```

Could use the ROUND function to round the ratings: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213746558-c907761d-8e6c-4928-94d4-71ac1f1170e3.png)

```sql
SELECT genre, ROUND(AVG(rating),2) AS avg_rating FROM series
JOIN reviews ON reviews.series_id = series.id
GROUP BY genre;
```

---

# TV Series Challenge #6


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213746984-be588acf-1ec6-463e-b1ef-84a445d53cc0.png)

Here, we want: 

* Each reviewer's `first_name` and `last_name`
* COUNT: the number of reviews they have left 
* MIN: the Minuimum score they have left 
* MAX: the maximum score they have left 
* AVG: their average score
* STATUS: this should be a conditional which should say active or inactive depending on whether a user has left a review or not.

In this task, we are joining information about `reviews` and `reviewers`.

---

Solution:

First, will do a join on both tables using  `*` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213750774-c25e752b-b4dd-4571-8162-9ecc81dd2a0d.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM reviewers
JOIN reviews ON reviews.reviewer_id = reviewers.id;
```

Here, we have the overlap between users and reviews.

But we also want to include `reviewers` who don't have reviews. To do this, let's do a `LEFT JOIN` because a left join get every row from reviewers plus any matching information from `reviews`. If there is no data in the right table for them, NULL is displayed...

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213757102-f279b45a-7fa8-43ae-bd4c-b2aab229cd80.png)

```sql
SELECT * FROM reviewers
LEFT JOIN reviews ON reviews.reviewer_id = reviewers.id;
```

---

Then, to count the amount of reviews each reviewer has left, we need to do a GROUP BY using the `first_name` and `last_name` and also select the  `first_name` and `last_name` and `rating` columns in the SELECT statement. Will use the COUNT function on the `rating` column so we can count the number of rewiews for each reviwer ...  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213762754-d2d4e8c1-c425-433c-b8b0-b1d45335914a.png)

```sql
SELECTSELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(rating) AS COUNT FROM reviewers
LEFT JOIN reviews ON reviews.reviewer_id = reviewers.id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name;
```

NOTE: in the above example, if we did `COUNT(*)`: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213762835-9a216289-6ded-42c3-998d-d0782ecfa386.png)

It would count the rows and as we know, Marlon Crawford does not have any reviews, but he does have one row.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213763060-2399d055-f43e-4cae-9e4a-be5356949907.png)

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, 
COUNT(*) AS COUNT, 
MIN(rating) AS MIN, MAX(rating) AS MAX FROM reviewers
LEFT JOIN reviews ON reviews.reviewer_id = reviewers.id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name;
```
Now we have included the MIN and MAX columns, however, the issue with this is that the Marlon Crafford row is showing NULL for MIN and MAX. We want it to show 0.0. To do this, we need to use `IFNULL`: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213763487-59683141-2099-4677-b8e7-2b0338dc89b5.png)

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, 
COUNT(*) AS COUNT, 
IFNULL(MIN(rating),0) AS MIN, IFNULL(MAX(rating),0) AS MAX FROM reviewers
LEFT JOIN reviews ON reviews.reviewer_id = reviewers.id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name;
```

So, if it is NULL, it will now show 0.
