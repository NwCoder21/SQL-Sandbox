# 6 - String Functions

Back story that we run a small online bookstore and we're being battered by Amazon. So we're fighting back the only way we know how, which is redoing 
our database inventory management system.


We're going to fight back by redoing our database, and that will be what we start this section doing. But then once we have that data in the database,
we're going to move on to learning a bunch of new commands. And those commands all are called string functions. These expand our way of selecting data and working 
with text or with strings 

---

<!-- Lesson 88 - The World Of String Functions --> 

We're going to be talking about some of the built in string functions. Now, string functions are different built in operations that we can perform on text columns.

These are string functions. we will cover around nine of them. Functions such as those which help us uppercase and lowercase text, to find the length of text, 
to reverse text, to replace parts of text, etc.

<!-- Lesson 89 - Loading Our Books Data --> 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207095857-1c78c643-bb54-4cd9-86a5-c6c8f8add871.png)

This is the database we will be working with.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bookShop;
USE bookShop;

CREATE TABLE books 
	(
		book_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
		title VARCHAR(100),
		author_fname VARCHAR(100),
		author_lname VARCHAR(100),
		released_year INT,
		stock_quantity INT,
		pages INT
	);

INSERT INTO books (title, author_fname, author_lname, released_year, stock_quantity, pages)
VALUES
('The Namesake', 'Jhumpa', 'Lahiri', 2003, 32, 291),
('Norse Mythology', 'Neil', 'Gaiman',2016, 43, 304),
('American Gods', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 2001, 12, 465),
('Interpreter of Maladies', 'Jhumpa', 'Lahiri', 1996, 97, 198),
('A Hologram for the King: A Novel', 'Dave', 'Eggers', 2012, 154, 352),
('The Circle', 'Dave', 'Eggers', 2013, 26, 504),
('The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 2000, 68, 634),

('A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius', 'Dave', 'Eggers', 2001, 104, 437),
('Coraline', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 2003, 100, 208),
('What We Talk About When We Talk About Love: Stories', 'Raymond', 'Carver', 1981, 23, 176),
("Where I'm Calling From: Selected Stories", 'Raymond', 'Carver', 1989, 12, 526),
('White Noise', 'Don', 'DeLillo', 1985, 49, 320),

('Oblivion: Stories', 'David', 'Foster Wallace', 2004, 172, 329),
('Consider the Lobster', 'David', 'Foster Wallace', 2005, 92, 343);
```
---

<!-- Lesson 91 - CONCAT  --> 

# CONCAT

`CONCAT` is short for concatenate, or combining strings, or combining text together. `CONCAT` combines data for cleaner output.

Most of what we're going to be doing with `CONCAT` is working with a table and concatenating different pieces of text together from a table from different rows. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207100664-a2e6192a-0061-4067-b4f9-c48107b46727.png)

`CONCAT` takes any number of strings and combines them together to form one piece of text.

---

This function is extremely useful when used with data from a table. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207101584-e00f6dff-64aa-404f-b447-bc5c8269cd5c.png)

For example, we want to combine the authors' first names and last names. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207102017-775ab6c4-163c-4906-85c4-675f5230c72d.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207102237-5f06bc78-6f1e-4865-b7ef-cb47b58f94dd.png)


So we can concatenate one column with another column. And that's exactly what we want to do. We want to `CONCAT` `author_fname` with `author_lname`.

```diff
- Note: Have to use `SELECT CONCAT` in order for it to work. If just use `CONCAT`, won't work and an error will occur. We need to use SELECT to get back results.
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207358037-1e48fd61-9a16-4295-8fdc-59bce2639aa1.png)

Here, have combined the authors' first and last names with a space in between first and last names.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207358570-43f1e5ca-c859-4a2a-9e54-fd695c6fa360.png)

Now we want to change the title for the result. To do this, we will use `AS`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207359206-b9545f6f-3839-460c-bf67-037e294f06b4.png)

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS authors_ FROM books; 
```

---

# `CONCAT_WS`

The WS stands for 'With seperator'.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207359905-8ffab7c2-6268-43e1-9487-2b8815a848f0.png)

<!-- L91 - 06:38 -->
Same concept as `CONCAT`, it will concat what we tell it to combine, but as the first argument, we provide it a separator. Whatever that separator character is, it will go between all the other arguments/each piece of information when they are combined. This character seperator will NOT be placed before the firat arguement not the last argument. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207360827-e68587df-e1b3-46b8-836a-f29bce639aba.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207361327-507a348b-e448-4142-96a9-3a1ea990e4b9.png)

Here, have added a space betweeb each piece of information.

---

<!-- L93 - SUBSTRING -->

# SUBSTRING

SUBSTRING is the next string function we will be looking at. This takes a larger string and returns a smaller portion of that strinf. 

This is what the Docs on this fuction say: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207364297-b1d8cb93-a616-4fca-b80a-6d5e3eea52e3.png)

---

Need to keep in mind following things about this function:

1. The first value we pass into this function is the string that we want to sample or take a substring from. Eventually that will be a column name. But for now, let's work with a single string.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207368555-bf3b375a-9405-4f3e-b576-eaacbca12bef.png)

The first argument, is the string we want to take out a substring from.

2. The second arguement, which is the first number, in this case `1`, is the starting position, in other words, character 1. This is where we want our substring to start from. 
3. The third argment, which is the second number, is how many characters we want to return. In this case, we want to return 4 characters. This is the length of the substring.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207369447-aa98a6b2-ab70-4268-9593-9304d24ebe98.png)

In the above example, `Hell` will be the substring which is returned.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207369675-39c1bdf1-e658-4045-b50c-a12b3109b042.png)

Space is also considered as a character.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207370353-758392d6-c95b-445c-927c-b8fcd7b1d159.png)

Here, the substring is starting at the second character and is 4 chracters long.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207372984-156b86af-71e2-4356-861f-f28654342993.png)

If we just provide a single number, it will start from that character and return fom that caharacter  till the end of the string.

---

When we start to combine this function with an existing table with rows, we can retreive dynamic substrings.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207373945-ff0ccf08-2beb-4f96-ba25-2118dfe8900f.png)

If we provide a negative number, it counts backwards, from the end of the string. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207374392-958432e4-6b62-4d39-910c-a8141b965ac8.png)

This starts from the second to last character, and moving backwards, returns 3 chracters.

---

Moving on, let's say we wanted to use this on our `books` table. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207375111-b00962a1-d09d-44bd-80d6-0349156b5fd2.png)

Let's say we wanted the first 15 characters from the title column.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207375870-11a83514-34e7-47e3-a674-7627edda0e8e.png)


---

# `SUBSTR()`

```diff
- Also, can use `SUBSTR()`, instead of SUBSTRING(). They work exactly the same. For example:
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207376269-3e4c399f-b9ec-4378-92d1-e0ca4c6d2be2.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207376776-c310cf26-213f-4904-af56-4b7b470dc24f.png)

Here, we are taking the first letter of the authors' first name and also returning their full last name.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207377184-0ac0ab3c-627e-49d1-80e7-728fea91f889.png)

Can also reame the columns in the results using `AS`.

```sql
SELECT SUBSTR(author_fname, 1,1) AS initial, author_lname AS lastName FROM books;
```

---

<!-- L95 - Combining String Functions -->

# Combining String Functions

In this section, will be combining `SUBSTRING` and `CONCAT`.

First we will try to re-create the below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207381552-53baa902-df01-4306-a4ef-8fd3285d3ad8.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207381792-3808cc49-d3a8-4919-a3d8-6d94e69a565f.png)

Here, we have used SUBSTRING to return the first 10 letters of each title. We then also need to add on `...`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207382732-9531030f-894f-4ee4-979e-e80030c6c044.png)

Here, `SUBSTR(title, 1,10)` takes place and the output of this is put into the input of `CONCAT(<ouput_of_SUBSTR>,'...')`.

---

```diff
- Remember, when nesting functions within one another, the inner functions are calculated first. 
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207383919-838d5032-e893-4999-9b72-aed5cec08757.png)

Here, have taken the inital of the first and last name of each author and added a `.` after each initial. We have done this using `CONCAT ()` and `SUBSTR()`.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(
	SUBSTR(author_fname, 1,1), '.', SUBSTR(author_lname, 1,1), '.')  
    AS authorInitials 
FROM books;
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207384630-8b417e10-b893-4876-b83f-d27edd045451.png)

Can also format it differently so more easier to read. 

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(
	SUBSTR(author_fname, 1,1), 
    '.', 
    SUBSTR(author_lname, 1,1), 
    '.')  
    AS authorInitials 
FROM books;
```

---

# SQL Formatting 

In MySQL Workbench, can highlight and click on the brush on the top to beautify and format the code. This allows youto write code in a moreconsistent manner.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207554943-2980697f-a390-4749-af14-683ce6d65db9.png)

---

<!-- Lesson 98 - REPLACE --> 

# `REPLACE`

`REPLACE` allows us to replace portions of a string with some other replacement string.

Remember, this does not replace/update the data in the database, rather, it changes the way it is displayed.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207555770-863337d8-6fb8-4008-8ccc-019a5def4022.png)

We can see from the docs that we have to provide `REPLACE` with three different string arguments. 

* The first string is the string we will be working on. In this case, `www.mysql.com`
* The second is the string we want to replace 
* and the third string is what we want to repalce the second string with.


So, instead of `www.mysql.com`, we will have `WwWwWw.mysql.com`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207557802-5abd29d4-c9b9-4cfe-acef-2736bb15cf39.png)

This is another example. World is replaced with Planet.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207558273-c8190845-cfa3-49b2-b6e8-70a8568bad34.png)

Here, we are replacing all the spaces with a ` and `.

---


```diff
- REPLACE is case senstive
```

This means: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207558778-23d80a47-8eef-49c0-ae67-f1cd9aa40e98.png)

World will not be replaced as we have used the lowercase in the second argument. The second argument needs to match with what you want to replace in the original string. 

---

Let's try to replace all spaces in the titles of our books table with a `-`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207566361-69a2e963-5064-4661-ad0d-6c21e29aa790.png)

---

Remember, this does not alter the contents of the table. so, if we now do a 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207567061-56881443-17c9-48b5-b6c1-a9030224721d.png)

The table is the same as before. This only chnages the way the contnts are outputted for the query only.

---

<!-- Lesson 100 - REVERSE --> 

# `REVERSE`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207605742-751ea65f-0b31-4341-b9c7-16c34391106f.png)

Reverse will take whatever string is provided to it and reverse it.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207605444-f5e973c2-1af8-4bab-9728-513d32f72690.png)

Casing is still preserved.

---

Only exception is `NULL`, for example: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207606006-7cb08f86-4d83-4199-8f67-8d2adf4768dd.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207606269-621218c7-edea-4b10-a1f4-d1677d8b9bbe.png)

---

<!-- Lesson 102 - CHAR_LENGTH --> 

# CHAR_LENGTH

This gives us the number of characters in a given string.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207567787-9f3d1cf1-7231-4220-8518-fb78b000ce12.png)

Here, it gives us the length of the `Hello World` string.

---

Note: the LENGTH() function returns the length of the string, measured in bytes.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207572792-ef590aa2-3d2d-46ab-9df0-98933427ca48.png)

LENGTH() will return a value in bytes. CHAR_LENGTH will return the number of characters in the given string.

---

Now let's find out the character length of the titles in the books table: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207574079-594edc73-90e4-43f6-b3d1-f8de05195a75.png)

```sql
SELECT title, CHAR_LENGTH(title) FROM books;
```
---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207574309-af80ad3f-f737-48ee-b033-c4dc62a3bcc0.png)

```sql
SELECT title, CHAR_LENGTH(title) AS title_length FROM books;
```
Here, have given the resulf of `CHAR_LENGTH` a title of `title_length`.

---

<!-- Lesson 104 - UPPER and LOWER  --> 

# `UPPER` & `LOWER`

These help to change the casing of the provided string.


UPPER will make the string uppercase and LOWER will make it lowercase.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207575705-8a6a7c89-514a-4fcb-8b30-17e1debf5954.png)

```sql
SELECT UPPER('HelLo WorLD');
```

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207575806-9a9a37da-1dd2-4036-a9ca-c0e7b4ab2756.png)

```sql
SELECT LOWER('HelLo WorLD');
```
---

There are shorter versions of each:

* `UPPER` can also be applied by using `UCASE` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207576760-de33d160-cf31-4d42-acc2-d6d12b46fb6c.png)

---

* `LOWER` can also be applied by using `LCASE` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207576926-b26e2d93-a062-4b19-9c45-191ac3f9c1da.png)

---

* Now back to our `books` table, let's output all titles in uppercase:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207577339-974358f3-2ff9-41a2-9fdd-64d16b5c8a34.png)


---

# Challenge 

Output for each title the following pattern:

```yaml
I think you should read the book  <uppercase_title> !!!
```

# Solution 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207578293-286ba19f-cc5e-4da2-a058-2ebc5022608c.png)

```sql
SELECT CONCAT('I think you should read the book ', UCASE(title), ' !!!') FROM books;
```

---

Soon we will learn how to do things like find the maximum of a list of values so we could find the longest book in terms of pages, or in terms of character length in the title, etc.

These string functions are crucial to learn as later on we will use them to manipulate the results based on our needs.

---

<!-- Lesson 106. Other String Functions  --> 

# Other String Functions

In this section will look at some more functions briefly:

# INSERT

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207584961-6c3f2eba-0dd1-4046-a407-0356e58bfb6e.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207580504-c44fe0f9-026a-4327-b7d8-0580c5bb1ddc.png)

With `INSERT` we can replace characters or we can simply add them on to a string.


This allows to insert a substring (fourth argument) into another string (first argument).

* The first number is the place from where to start replacing. 
* If the second number is 0, it will just add third arguement on to exisitng string, such as:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207581447-6fbb1b3d-f0d8-48ea-ba15-84170027bd27.png)


* If the second number is something other than 0, it will repalce that many characters from exisitng string from the position of the first number, such as:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207582055-7ebfd11a-5f35-4826-8f03-6c2f60b272e4.png)

In this scenario, the fourth string is inserted as it has been written by the user  and then exisiting characters are cut by the number in the third arguement.

Summary: the two numbers are: 

* The first number is where something will be inserted.
* The second number is how many characters to replace.

---

# `LEFT()`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207582790-3495a67f-46c1-432b-b179-3574947e391e.png)

This function is used to get the leftmost characters in a string, in other words, the first amount of characters in a string.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207583139-0fad1bc6-27a0-4a04-8012-e7ba1e100e9b.png)

---

# `RIGHT()`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207583354-a644358b-2349-4263-9cbd-a80f34382a00.png)

This function is used to get the rightmost characters in a string, in other words, the last amount of characters in a string.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207583421-3391656a-2d17-4976-910c-1f1f1a5a7f6e.png)

---

In our `books` table,, we could use this to retrieve the initials of the authors:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/207584062-0636753b-8e33-47b3-bc84-b58785c3efdd.png)

```sql
SELECT 
    LEFT(author_fname, 1) AS firstInitial,
    LEFT(author_lname, 1) AS LastInitial
FROM books;
```

`Trim` is used to remove usually spaces that are leading and trailing.

This removes spaces on either side of the string. However, it does not remove spaces which occur in between within the string. That is why there is still a space between `Hello` and `World` in the above example,

---

We can also use `LEADING` and `TRAILING` with `TRIM` to remove specifc characters.

Here, the `.`s are not removed as they are not spaces. 

---

To remove the ones to the left, we can use `LEADING` followed by what character we want to remove, such as:

To remove the `.`s on the right, we can use we can use `TRAILING` followed by what character we want to remove, such as:

---

To remove from both sides the `.`s, we can use `BOTH`:
