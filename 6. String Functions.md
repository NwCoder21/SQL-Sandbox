# 6 - String Functions

Back story that we run a small online bookstore and we're being battered by Amazon. So we're fighting back the only way we know how, which is redoing 
our database inventory management system.


We're going to fight back by redoing our database, and that will be what we start this section doing. But then once we have that data in the database,
we're going to move on to learning a bunch of new commands. And those commands all are called string functions. These expand our way of selecting data and working 
with text or with strings

These are string functions. we will cover around nine of them. Functions such as those which help us uppercase and lowercase text, to find the length of text, 
to reverse text, to replace parts of text, etc.
