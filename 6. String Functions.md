# 6 - String Functions

Back story that we run a small online bookstore and we're being battered by Amazon. So we're fighting back the only way we know how, which is redoing 
our database inventory management system.


We're going to fight back by redoing our database, and that will be what we start this section doing. But then once we have that data in the database,
we're going to move on to learning a bunch of new commands. And those commands all are called string functions. These expand our way of selecting data and working 
with text or with strings

<!-- Lesson 88 - The World Of String Functions --> 

We're going to be talking about some of the built in string functions. Now, string functions are different built in operations that we can perform on text columns.

These are string functions. we will cover around nine of them. Functions such as those which help us uppercase and lowercase text, to find the length of text, 
to reverse text, to replace parts of text, etc.

This is the database we will be working with.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bookShop;
USE bookShop;

CREATE TABLE books 
	(
		book_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
		title VARCHAR(100),
		author_fname VARCHAR(100),
		author_lname VARCHAR(100),
		released_year INT,
		stock_quantity INT,
		pages INT
	);

INSERT INTO books (title, author_fname, author_lname, released_year, stock_quantity, pages)
VALUES
('The Namesake', 'Jhumpa', 'Lahiri', 2003, 32, 291),
('Norse Mythology', 'Neil', 'Gaiman',2016, 43, 304),
('American Gods', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 2001, 12, 465),
('Interpreter of Maladies', 'Jhumpa', 'Lahiri', 1996, 97, 198),
('A Hologram for the King: A Novel', 'Dave', 'Eggers', 2012, 154, 352),
('The Circle', 'Dave', 'Eggers', 2013, 26, 504),
('The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 2000, 68, 634),

('A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius', 'Dave', 'Eggers', 2001, 104, 437),
('Coraline', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 2003, 100, 208),
('What We Talk About When We Talk About Love: Stories', 'Raymond', 'Carver', 1981, 23, 176),
("Where I'm Calling From: Selected Stories", 'Raymond', 'Carver', 1989, 12, 526),
('White Noise', 'Don', 'DeLillo', 1985, 49, 320),
('Cannery Row', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 1945, 95, 181),
('Oblivion: Stories', 'David', 'Foster Wallace', 2004, 172, 329),

<!-- Lesson 91 - CONCAT  --> 

# CONCAT

`CONCAT` is short for concatenate, or combining strings, or combining text together. `CONCAT` combines data for cleaner output.

Most of what we're going to be doing with `CONCAT` is working with a table and concatenating different pieces of text together from a table from different rows.

`CONCAT` takes any number of strings and combines them together to form one piece of text.

---

This function is extremely useful when used with data from a table.

For example, we want to combine the authors' first names and last names.

So we can concatenate one column with another column. And that's exactly what we want to do. We want to `CONCAT` `author_fname` with `author_lname`.
